__label__business a us government claim accusing the country ' s biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court .  the demand for $280bn  ( £155bn )  - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - was rejected in a 2-1 decision .  the court in washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws .  among the accused were altria group ,  rj reynolds tobacco ,  lorillard tobacco ,  liggett group and brown and williamson .  in its case ,  the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction ,  targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns ,  lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary .  prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products .  but the court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the us government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract mafia infiltration of business .  the tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public .  they also say they have already met many of the government ' s demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998 .  shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling ,  with altria rising 5% and reynolds showing gains of 4 . 5% .

"we are disappointed that the bafin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved , " citigroup said .  if the traders are found guilty ,  they could face a five-year jail term or a fine ,  reuters reported bafin as saying .  however ,  under german criminal law ,  prosecutors cannot pursue citigroup itself .  germany ' s financial watchdog bafin told bbc news it had now transferred the investigation to the public prosecutor .

__label__sport sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal .  the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests ,  including one on the eve of the athens olympics .  but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport .  the pair ' s former coach ,  christos tzekos ,  has been banned for four years .  kenteris ,  31 ,  and thanou ,  30 ,  had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv ,  chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics .  they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august .  the pair then spent four days in a hospital ,  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash .  it was the international olympic committee ' s demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal .  the head of that tribunal ,  kostas panagopoulos ,  said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens .  "the charge cannot be substantiated , " he said .  "in no way was he  ( kenteris )  informed to appear for a doping test .  the same goes for thanou . " kenteris ' s lawyer ,  gregory ioannidis ,  said: "the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career .  "he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january .  "this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one .  it shows he has no case to answer .  "mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character .  "he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures . " but the iaaf said it was "very surprised" by the verdict .  spokesman nick davies said: "we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest .  "our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision . "
__label__entertainment people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows ,  real experts say .  evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes ,  at a time when many have large backlogs ,  science investigators claim .  lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used .  the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc .  crime scene investigation  ( csi )  and its spin-offs ,  csi: miami and csi: new york ,  have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic .  each episode ,  a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal .  "the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show , " said max houck ,  who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university ,  us .  "this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof , " he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science  ( aaas )  .  the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200 , 000-300 , 000 backlogged dna samples in us labs .  yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog ,  said dr houck .  forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show ' s influence in dealing with the families of victims .  "what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case , " she explained .  "for example ,  on television ,  the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously .  but when people find out that it can take several months ,  they can find that very difficult . " dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people ' s perceptions .  the show ' s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom ,  making lawyers jittery .  "prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because ,  for example ,  they wonder:  ' why wasn ' t everything tested ?  '  well ,  in fact ,  not everything needs to be tested , " dr houck explained .  "defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that ' s always accurate . " however ,  he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field .  "my university course started with four graduates in 1999; we ' re now the largest major on campus - with 400 students , " he said .  dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: "there ' s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research .

__label__business the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams ,  the chinese state press has said .  the builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam ,  said the beijing news .  the xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks .  the beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine .  the firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant .  so far ,  only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china ' s state environmental protection agency  ( sepa )  for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order .  the china three gorges project corp could now face a fine up to 200 , 000 yuan  ( $24 , 000; £12 , 700 )  .  last week ,  it denied that its projects violated regulations .  "the three gorges corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law , " it said .  the sepa order comes as the chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country ' s booming economy .  previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages ,  which forced many factories into part-time working last year .  in 2004 ,  china increased its generating capacity by 12 . 6% to 440 , 700 megawatts  ( mw )  .  the xiluodu dam is designed to produce 12 , 600 mw of electricity ,  and is being built on the jinshajiang - or "river of golden sand" as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known .  it is a sister project to the main three gorges dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated ,  drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists .

__label__politics charles clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial id cards bill .  up to 30 labour mps could oppose the scheme during a commons debate .  mr clarke ,  who took on the post on thursday after david blunkett quit ,  has rejected calls to "pause" on the bill .  tory leader michael howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards .  the liberal democrats oppose the plans .  mr clarke ,  writing in the times ,  accused some critics of "liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears" by claiming id cards would erode civil liberties .  he writes that it is actually a "profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society - which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear" .  mr clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail .  he is also expected to cut the £85 cost of the card and passport ,  for the elderly and those on lower incomes .  mr howard last week said his front bench team had reached a "collective view" to back id cards after holding a "good discussion" ,  but admitted it was "not an easy issue" .  he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror ,  crime and illegal immigration .  but former shadow attorney general bill cash said there was still "very deep" disquiet about the plan among senior tories .  he told bbc radio 4 ' s today the government was "intensely authoritarian" and was creating "increasingly a big brother society" .  critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim .  ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism ,  illegal immigration and organised crime .  but opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the madrid rail bombing .  on sunday ,  lib dem leader charles kennedy repeated his call for a "pause" in considering the legislation .  he told bbc ' s breakfast with frost programme that mr clarke had a "real opportunity" on monday following the departure of mr blunkett .  "if you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the identity cards bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the new year ?  "that is the sensible way to go about it but i think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all . " the first cards would be issued in 2008 and ,  when he was introducing the bill ,  mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards ,  although not to carry them .  the new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents . 
__label__business as the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january ,  a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe .  the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble .  and its owner ,  p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year ' s profits and a potential pr fiasco .  no-one ,  however ,  seems to have told the stock markets .  the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world ' s biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival ' s share price ,  from £35 to £36 . 20 .  other investors barely blinked ,  and by 1300 gmt carnival ' s shares in london were down a single penny ,  or 0 . 03% ,  at £32 . 26 .  why the mismatch between the public perception and the market ' s response ?  "the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time , " says deutsche bank ' s simon champion .  "it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise ,  after all .  but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events . " despite its string of bad luck ,  he pointed out ,  aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet ,  the uk ' s p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003 .  and generally speaking ,  carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule .  "carnival has an incredibly strong track record , " mr champion .  similarly ,  analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited .  the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise .  that should mitigate some of the pr risk ,  both for carnival and its main competitor ,  royal caribbean .  "while not common ,  cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry , " wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday .  "moreover ,  such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises . " after all ,  the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it ' s unlikely to make too much of a splash .  assuming that citigroup is right ,  and demand stays solid ,  the structure of the industry also works in carnival ' s favour .  in the wake of p&o princess ' s takeover by carnival ,  the business is now to a great extent a duopoly .  given the expense of building ,  outfitting and running a cruise ship ,  "slowing supply growth" is a certainty ,  said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday .  in other words ,  if you do want a cruise ,  your options are limited .  and with carnival remaining the market leader ,  it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future .

"what we ' re doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action , " mr blair said .  "when you are doing these types of activities you ' ve got to exercise some common sense there obviously .  "you can ' t have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they ' re going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character . " the pledge on education - "your child achieving more" - was one of six election pledges unveiled by mr blair last week .  if it wins a third term in the general election expected this year ,  labour is committed to giving parents more choice between schools; allowing all secondary schools to take on specialist status; opening 200 city academies and creating 100 , 000 more sixth-form places .  it aims to improve discipline in schools by adopting a "zero tolerance" approach to disruption of classes and introducing fixed penalty notices for truants .  labour also plans to give head teachers at groups of local schools control over funding for units to handle disruptive pupils .  parents and teachers who met mr blair on tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their mps to raise concerns about education .  it is the latest in a series of events designed to show the prime minister is speaking directly to voters in the run-up to the election - and that he has not lost touch .  for the conservatives ,  shadow education secretary tim collins said: "mr blair&#191;s government is all talk .  he must be judged on what he has done in two terms ,  not what he mendaciously claims he would do in a third .  that judgment will be damning .

__label__business irish publishing group independent news & media is buying up a 26% stake in indian newspaper company jagran in a deal worth 25m euros  ( $34 . 1m )  .  jagran publishes india ' s top-selling daily newspaper ,  the hindi-language dainik jagran ,  which has been in circulation for 62 years .  news of the deal came as the group announced that its results would meet market forecasts .  the company reported strong revenue growth across all its major markets .  group advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year ,  the group said ,  with overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% year-on-year .  this was helped by the positive impact of "compact" newspaper editions in ireland and the uk ,  it said .  "2004 has proven to be an important year for independent news & media , " said chief executive sir anthony o ' reilly .  "our simple aim at independent is to be the low cost producer in every region in which we operate .  i am confident that we will show a meaningful increase in earnings for 2005 . " meanwhile ,  the group made no comment about the future of the independent newspaper despite recent speculation that sir anthony had held talks with potential buyers over a stake in the daily publication .  he has consistently denied suggestions that the independent and the independent on sunday are up for sale .  buy it is understood that the recent success of the smaller edition of the independent ,  which has pushed circulation up by 20% to 260 , 000 ,  has prompted interest from industry rivals ,  with daily mail & general trust tipped as the most likely suitor .  the loss-making newspaper is not expected to reach break-even until 2006 .

__label__sport the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up .  it may have to go the whole way and have nfl-style video cameras all over the field ,  or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles .  what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself .  sunday ' s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948 .  the game was as exciting as it comes ,  with a much-improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way .  one can understand that frustration .  there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory ,  but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport ' s "blazers" .  referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece .  i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made .  after all ,  he has no public recourse to criticism .  it was the same for simon mcdowell ,  the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france .  as far as england were concerned ,  there were queries over mark cueto ' s first half-effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick .  england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup .  on that occasion ,  david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe ,  who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out .  but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies .  perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end .  lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control .  however ,  one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o ' connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown .  but in rugby ,  everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes .  the referee also missed england ' s danny grewcock taking out ronan o ' gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line .  those were the stand-out moments in a classic game between the two old foes .  but there were many more ,  and one should not take away from those .  brian o ' driscoll ' s winning try was as well-conceived as they come ,  while charlie hodgson ' s brilliant kicking display was another highlight .  and ronan o ' gara ' s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component .  but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes .  two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on .  the first was denis hickie ' s brilliant double tackle in the right-hand corner .  he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross-field kick ,  then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try .  ireland ' s second-row colossus paul o ' connell was equally superb .  england had turned ireland one way then the other ,  and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating .  england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers .  unfortunately he ran into o ' connell who hit him hard - very hard - and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover .  that spoke volumes about ireland ' s back-foot display ,  with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end .  to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward .  it may be tries that win games ,  but it is defence that wins championships .

__label__politics eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed .  john houston ,  54 ,  was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election .  but he was suspended after his reported views ,  including the return of the british empire ,  were sent to two scottish newspapers .  ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views .  the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip ,  soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk .  mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be "made available to law-abiding members of the community" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade .  the document reportedly said: "we ' re looking for the resurrection of the british empire .  "the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale ,  and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations ,  which they are uniquely able to do . " mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston ' s reported views had been presented as ukip policy ,  which they were not .  he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party ' s manifesto ,  but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate .  he told bbc news: "he appears to have said these things .  we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate .  "by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting .  "it is simply a distraction from the task in hand ,  the eu constitution ,  not individual idiocies .

__label__politics the government ' s immigration rules racially discriminated against roma  ( gypsies )  seeking entry into the uk ,  the law lords have ruled .  it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people ,  mostly roma ,  from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital ,  prague .  civil rights group liberty said it exposed "racism at the heart of the government ' s asylum policy" .  the home office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone .  it said it would look at the implications of the ruling ,  but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because czechs are now entitled to free movement across europe .  the screening took place at the airport in july 2001 ,  at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering britain .  those refused "pre-clearance" were effectively prevented from travelling to the uk ,  because no airline would carry them .  lady hale ,  sitting with lords bingham ,  steyn ,  hope and carswell ,  said many roma had good reason to want to leave the czech republic because of persecution .  but she said they were treated more sceptically than non-roma passengers by immigration officers "acting on racial grounds" .  lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way ,  only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason .  liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non-roma czechs .  it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain ,  and that of the european roma rights centre ,  which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people .  it lost a high court action in october 2002 when a judge said the system was "no more or less objectionable" than a visa control system .  he ruled there was no obligation on britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum .  the court of appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against roma ,  but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum .  immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries ,  but it does not allow officers to go further than that .  responding to the ruling ,  a home office spokesman said: "the scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk . " welcoming the ruling ,  maeve sherlock ,  chief executive of the refugee council ,  said: "human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented ,  and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group . " amnesty international ' s jan shaw said: "that the government ' s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse ,  not least in the czech republic . " but the chairman of migration watch uk ,  sir andrew green ,  said the house of lords decision was a "step in the wrong direction" .  "the basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits . "

__label__tech a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers ,  a trade body has warned .  the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force .  but the uk internet forum  ( ukif )  is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily .  the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language .  registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers ,  says stephen dyer ,  director of ukif .  domain names are the "real language" addresses of websites ,  rather than their internet protocol address ,  which is a series of numbers .  they are used so people can more easily navigate the web .  so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used .  so ,  for example ,  website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet .  the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian  ' a '  look just like an english  ' a '  .  but the computer code would be different ,  and the site it would lead users to could be a fake .  this is more than just a theory .  a fake paypal . com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name  ( idn )  system ,  said mr dyer .  as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent ,  mr dyer said .  "although the idn problem is well known in technical circles ,  the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked , " said mr dyer .  "it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site , " he added .  there are solutions .  for instance ,  browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users .  mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world ' s browsers .  another solution ,  to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of "throwing out the baby with the bath water , " he said .  centr ,  the council of european national top level domain registries ,  agrees .  "a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world , " the organisation said in a statement . 
__label__business the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros  ( $91m )  in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction .  the financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed .  the french wine industry ,  the world ' s second largest ,  has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines .  wine makers ,  however ,  claimed the support did not go far enough .  the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners '  representatives .  the bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments .  a further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives ,  which make up the majority of french producers ,  in low interest loans .  efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3 . 5m euros in funding .  france fell behind the  ' new world '  producers of australia ,  chile and the united states for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports .  domestic consumption ,  accounting for 70% of sales ,  has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws .  the aid package would "create a positive climate around french viticulture , " mr bussereau said .  however ,  wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for .  "i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions , " jean-michel lemetayer ,  from the fnsea agricultural union ,  told the associated press news agency .  in an effort to tackle overcapacity ,  the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent ,  while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement .  the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol ,  with vintners receiving compensation .  production is currently outstripping demand by about 30% .  the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry .  wine makers in france ' s best-known regions ,  such as burgundy ,  have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers .

"there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future , " said jean-philippe cotis ,  the oecd ' s chief economist .  the price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004 ,  but down on the record high of $55 . 67 set in late october .  a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending ,  the oecd said .  "the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies .  if the oil price does not rise any further ,  then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters , " vincent koen ,  a senior economist with the oecd ,  told the bbc ' s world business report .  "the recovery that was underway ,  and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year ,  would then regain momentum in the course of 2005 . " china ' s booming economy and a "spectacular comeback" in japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery ,  the oecd said .

"i am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number .  the main drag came from electronics , " said lian chia liang ,  economist at jp morgan chase .  singapore ' s economy had contracted over the summer ,  weighed down by soaring oil prices .  the economy ' s poor performance in the july to september period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly sars virus in 2003 .

" but her spokesman insisted she had simply delayed submitting her entry .  "the doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play .  but if there ' s the least risk she will stay away . " despite being absent from the wta entry list for the tournament ,  which begins on 17 january ,  clijsters would be certain to get a wild card if she requested one .  clijsters is still ranked 22nd in the world despite only playing a handful of matches last season .  the belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour .  meanwhile ,  jelena dokic ,  who used to compete for australia ,  has opted out of the first grand slam of the season .  dokic has not played in the australian open since 2001 when she lost in the first round .  but the 21-year-old would have had to rely on a wild card next season because her ranking has tumbled to 127th .  four-time champion monica seles ,  who has not played since last year ' s french open ,  is another absentee because of an injured left foot . 
__label__sport an investigation into doping claims against marion jones has been opened by the international olympic committee .  ioc president jacques rogge has set up a disciplinary body to look into claims by victor conte ,  of balco laboratories .  jones ,  who says she is innocent ,  could lose all her olympic medals after conte said he gave her performance-enhancing drugs before the sydney olympics .  but rogge said it was too early to speculate about that ,  hoping only that "the truth will emerge" .  any decision on the medals would be taken by the ioc ' s executive board and could hinge on interpretation of a rule stating that olympic decisions can only be challenged within three years of the games closing .  the sydney olympics ended more than four years ago ,  but world anti-doping agency chief dick pound said the rule may not apply because the allegations are only coming out now .  "we will find a way to deal with that , " pound said .  in a statement released through her attorney rich nichols ,  jones repeated her innocence and vowed she would be cleared .  "victor conte ' s allegations are not true and the truth will be revealed for the world to see as the legal process moves forward , " she said .  "conte is someone who is under federal indictment and has a record of issuing contradictory ,  inconsistent statements . "
__label__business russian authorities do not have to abide by any us court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant yukos ,  a houston court has been told .  legal expert william butler said there was no treaty between the us and russia to recognise the other ' s legal rulings .  that meant moscow would not have to adhere to us rulings in the yukos case .  yukos says a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold ,  since it has a us subsidiary and local bank accounts .  yukos made its surprise chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in houston in december in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of yugansk ,  its main oil producing unit ,  by russian authorities .  yugansk was sold to help pay off a $27 . 5bn  ( £14 . 5bn )  back tax bill .  it was bought for $9 . 4bn by a previously unknown group ,  which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company rosneft .  the us court ' s jurisdiction has been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft ,  a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft .  deutsche bank maintains the case has no place in a us court because yukos has no assets in the us ,  apart from two bank accounts and a house in houston owned by its chief finance officer bruce misamore .  deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos .  it had agreed to loan gazpromneft the money to bid for yugansk .  us bankruptcy judge letitia clark ,  who issued an injunction in december to try and prevent the yugansk sale ,  has said she will rule "pretty promptly ,  however i do not anticipate ruling on it before next tuesday" .  yukos has claimed it sought help in the us because other forums - russian courts and the european court of human rights - were either unfriendly or offered less protection .  it has claimed that russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy yukos and its former owner mihkail khodorkovsky ,  who is facing a 10-year prison term in russia for fraud and tax evasion .  yukos '  parent company ,  the gibraltar-based menatep group ,  is suing russia in europe for $28 . 3bn in financial damages .  the company is also seeking $20bn in a separate us lawsuit against rosneft and gazprom for their role in the sale of yugansk . 
__label__tech analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son ' s hands .  i bought my son max a 3g phone ,  partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone ,  and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life .  after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phone .  that has a relatively large screen ,  even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network .  i can read my e-mail ,  surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen .  last week someone e-mailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file ,  and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me .  by contrast the confusing menus ,  complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max ' s 3g phone simply get in the way ,  and i did not see much value in the paid-for services ,  especially the limited web access .  the videos of entertainment news ,  horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal ,  and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image ,  never mind micro-tv .  but then max started playing ,  and i realised i was missing the point entirely .  it is certainly not a great overall experience ,  but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling .  the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website ,  and the image is about the same size .  max was completely captivated ,  and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution .  it is easy to be dismissive of small screens ,  and indeed anyone of my generation ,  with failing eyesight and the view that  ' there ' s never anything worth watching on tv '  ,  is hardly going to embrace these phones .  but just as the world wide web was the "killer application" that drove internet adoption ,  music videos are going to drive 3g adoption .  with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service ,  and 3 already established in the uk ,  video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus ,  adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress .  this will please the network operators ,  who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3g licences .  but it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the  ' download and play '  model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players .  after all ,  why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want ,  whenever i want ,  streamed to my phone ?  oh - and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts ,  something which ensures that it is always in someone ' s pocket or handbag ,  available for other uses too .  i have never really approved of using the internet protocol  ( ip )  ,  to do either audio or video streaming ,  and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using "voice over ip" .  but i have to acknowledge that the net ,  at least here in the developed western countries ,  is fast and reliable enough to do both .  i stream radio to my computer while i work ,  and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else .  i am even playing with internet telephony ,  despite my reservations ,  and i appear on go digital on the world service ,  streamed over the web each week .  but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming ,  both for voice and video ,  which gives them an edge over net-based ip services .  the 3g services aren ' t quite there yet ,  and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges .  vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live !  as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites - this one ,  for example .  this will not matter to business users ,  but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company ' s collection of partner sites ,  something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom .  but we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals .  if i want fast access to my e-mail i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network .  the phone is a lot more ,  and it is as a combination of mini-tv ,  personal communications device and music / video player that it really works .  there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices ,  accessing a wide range of services over different networks .  3g phones and ipods can co-exist ,  at least for a while ,  but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket .  or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both .  an mp3g player ,  anyone ?

__label__sport british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year ' s rbs six nations championship .  world cup winners lawrence dallaglio ,  neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer ' s tour to new zealand .  "i don ' t think you can ever say never , " said woodward .  "but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby . " dallaglio ,  back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides .  but woodward added: "the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark .  "my job ,  along with all the other senior representatives ,  is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team .  "if you are not playing international rugby then it ' s still a step up to test rugby .  it ' s definitely a disadvantage .  "i think it ' s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries . " woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open .  "it is an open book , " he said .  "there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries . " and following the all blacks '  impressive displays in europe in recent weeks ,  including a 45-6 humiliation of france ,  woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge .  "their performance in particular against france was simply awesome , " said the lions coach .  "certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five ,  but they ' re a very powerful unit . " with his customary thoroughness ,  woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland .  as a result ,  woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots .  "scotland ' s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances .  "eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions . " and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call ,  provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems .  "i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn ' t fit and went on the trip .  "every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip .  "i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions - and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat . "

__label__sport has there been a better six nations match than saturday ' s epic in paris ?  and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 ?  those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris .  welsh legend mervyn davies ,  a member of two of three grand slam-winning sides of the 1970s ,  hailed it as "one of the great performances of the past three decades" .  martyn williams ,  wales '  two-try scorer on the day ,  called it "one of the most surreal games i have ever played in" .  a crestfallen france coach ,  bernard laporte ,  simply observed: "there was a french half and there was a welsh half" .  and what a half it was for the red dragonhood ,  transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period .  but while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure ,  the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side .  that they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time ,  then reverse it on the resumption ,  was remarkable enough .  but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes ,  wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve .  in international rugby ,  any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day ,  but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis .  england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory ,  the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered .  wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light .  but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline .  ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33-5 in paris two years ago .  but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup ,  wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place .  "the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class , " noted coach mike ruddock .  the likes of michael owen ,  gethin jenkins ,  dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer ' s lions tour to new zealand .  and players like stephen jones ,  martyn williams ,  shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve .  jones ,  after his superb man-of-the-match display ,  observed that "we are a very happy camp now" .  ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ,  ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad .  the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second-half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s .  if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship ,  they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats .  similarly ,  wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches ,  and that forward power ,  mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important .  so on to murrayfield ,  where wales have not won on their last three visits .  while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive ,  the players will set about the task of beating scotland .  only then - with the visit of ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s ,  and writing their own names into welsh legend . 
__label__politics charles clarke says he has "no desire" to offer more concessions on his controversial anti-terror plans to get them on to the statute book .  mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes - but labour ' s majority was reduced to 14 .  the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals .  lord strathclyde ,  tory leader in the lords ,  said ministers should expect it to be "substantially re-written" .  the bill proposes "control orders" ,  which as well as house arrest could impose curfews ,  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use .  they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial ,  which the law lords have ruled against .  on monday ,  mps voted 272-219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke .  the government earlier saw its 161-strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels .  mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order ,  amounting to house arrest ,  would be imposed by judges and not politicians .  lord strathclyde warned ministers that they should "prepare themselves for substantial rewriting of various aspects of the bill" .  "they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals ,  which are for house arrest . " but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords .  "no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made ,  but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords , " he said .  "i have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the bill . " mr clarke ' s proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps .  the debate is unlikely to result in a vote .  speaking after the commons debate ,  shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been "clearly very badly drawn-up" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly .  he said it would be possible to "rescue" the government and make the law "tolerable" by amending it in the lords .  "the scope for miscarriages of justice is enormous , " he told bbc news .  mark oaten ,  for the liberal democrats ,  said monday night ' s vote showed the government had "lost the confidence of all sides of the house" .  he said: "they need to rethink the bill ,  and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders ,  build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects .  "unless there is a major movement ,  this bill is doomed to fail . " bbc news political editor andrew marr said: "i think that this is a bill in deep trouble .  it ' s been unravelling in the house of commons - it may unravel further . " the government wants the new bill to pass into law by 14 march ,  when the current powers expire .

__label__business bmw has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004 .  the luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - bmw ,  mini and rolls-royce - in asia last year after the launch of three new models .  the company ,  which is vying with mercedes-benz for the title of leading premium carmaker ,  is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005 .  it is launching a revamped version of its 3-series saloon class next month .  bmw sold nearly 95 , 000 cars in asia last year ,  up 2 . 6% on 2003 .  bmw-brand sales rose 2 . 3% to 80 , 600 while sales of mini models rose 3 . 6% to 14 , 800 .  there was also a significant increase in sales of rolls-royces on the continent .  bmw sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year .  the german carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in asia to 150 , 000 by 2008 .  "here in asia ,  we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features , " said helmut panke ,  bmw ' s group chief executive .  china remains the main area of concern for bmw after sales there fell 16% last year .  however ,  bmw is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in china begins to pay dividends .  the company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in china in 2003 .  2004 was generally a good year for bmw ,  which saw revenues from its core car-making operations rise 11% . 
__label__politics the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build 100 , 000 new "affordable" homes on publicly owned land .  the party ' s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust ,  as a way of getting onto the housing ladder .  the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites .  labour has already announced plans to help first-time buyers and the tories would extend right-to-buy schemes .  all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of uk towns .  the lib dems say their "mutual homes" would let people buy a share of a property ,  usually worth about 5% of the building costs .  party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land ,  donated by central or local government .  people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land ,  he added .  they would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property .  when they moved house ,  they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share .  it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account .  mr kennedy said: "mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually ,  investing only as much as they can afford . " there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities .  the kind of "golden share" used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely .  under the plan ,  councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market .  instead ,  they are sold at "build cost" to people who the local council decides have local needs .  the party says its help for first-time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer .  but the plans involve changing the vat system ,  which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings .  the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to £11 , 000 on every new house .  "this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy , " said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman .  "they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder ,  but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market .

__label__entertainment actor robert blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead ,  a court has heard .  but it may not have come from the shot that killed bonny lee bakley in 2001 ,  mr blake ' s murder trial was told by criminalist steven dowell .  mr dowell told a los angeles court the residue may have come from mr blake ' s revolver ,  his gun collection ,  his presence at the crime scene or police .  the 71-year-old former star of us tv drama baretta has denied murder .  mr blake said he found ms bakley ,  44 ,  dead in a car after they left a restaurant .  he said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned .  the gun he collected was not the murder weapon .  it could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body ,  or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored .  the box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range .  but mr dowell also said the residue would have been present if mr blake fired a gun that night .  witnesses have already told the trial mr blake "stood out as being quite nervous and agitated" at the restaurant before the murder .  the actor ,  who won an emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s tv cop drama baretta ,  could face life in prison if convicted . 
__label__tech the hi-tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required .  often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision .  but that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration .  and vice versa .  uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative .  the idea ,  says bt ,  is to shape a "21st century model" which will help cement the art ,  technology ,  and business worlds together .  "we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology , " said frank stone ,  head of the bt ' s business sector programmes .  he looks after several "centres of excellence" which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations ,  one of which is focused on creative industries .  to mark the initiative ' s launch ,  a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels ,  with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer .  they have both been created using the telco ' s technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm ,  including a sophisticated graphics rendering program .  using a 3d graphics engine ,  the type commonly used in gaming ,  bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual ,  story-based ,  3d model of brussels '  coudenberg cellars .  they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace ,  an historical seat of european power .  the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century .  "the river was integral to the city ' s survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared , " said the artists .  "we hope that by uncovering the river ,  we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present ,  and appreciate the flow of modernity ,  once concealing ,  but now revealing the river senne . " in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine .  the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering ,  game ai ,  and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game .  they are so time-consuming and expensive to create ,  the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games .  bt ' s own engine ,  tara  ( total abstract rendering architecture )  has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners .  it was also used in 2003 in encounter ,  an urban-based ,  pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical ,  on-the-street action .  because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds ,  new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets .  but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new ,  and many keen coders ,  designers ,  games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself .  as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street ,  enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance ,  creativity will become an integral part of technology .  the orange expressionist exhibition last year ,  for example ,  displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation .  technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential ,  not least because it gives people something to do with their technology .  big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too .  the art world is "fantastically rich" ,  said mr stone ,  with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them .  between 1997 and 2002 ,  the creative industry brought £21 billion to london alone .  it is an industry that is growing by 6% a year too .  the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net ,  according to mr stone .  "this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online , " he said .  "it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem . " with broadband penetration reaching 100% in the uk ,  businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it .  the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously .  it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries ,  or more patent ideas for tech companies .  "what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking .  "we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy , " said mr stone .

__label__tech nicholas negroponte ,  chairman and founder of mit ' s media labs ,  says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100  ( £53 )  .  he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries .  he said one laptop per child could be " very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family ,  village and neighbourhood" .  he said the child could use the laptop like a text book .  he described the device as a stripped down laptop ,  which would run a linux-based operating system ,  "we have to get the display down to below $20 ,  to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel .  "the second trick is to get rid of the fat  ,  if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory . " the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down .  mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture ,  though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money .  in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital ,  now widely seen as predicting the digital age .  the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine ,  where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on .  while the idea was popular amongst the children ,  it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken .  however ,  mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops .  "we put in 25 laptops three years ago  ,  only one has been broken ,  the kids cherish these things ,  it ' s also a tv a telephone and a games machine ,  not just a textbook . " mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious .  "nokia make 200 million cell phones a year ,  so for us to claim we ' re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number ,  but we ' re not talking about doing it in three or five years ,  we ' re talking about months . " he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order .  "in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks .  that ' s for five or six years ,  so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that ' s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away .

__label__business the european commission has written to the mobile phone operators vodafone and t-mobile to challenge "the high rates" they charge for international roaming .  in letters sent to the two companies ,  the commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the german mobile phone market .  it is the second time vodafone has come under the commission ' s scrutiny .  the uk operator is already appealing against allegations that its uk roaming rates are "unfair and excessive" .  vodafone ' s response to the commission ' s letter was defiant .

"back when i started in 1974 ,  there were very few women in the industry , " she said in 2003 .  "i was assumed to be the make-up and hair person ,  or the script person .  i was never assumed to be the writer or producer .

"the works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from london in the future , " reuters news agency reports a union source as saying .  german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator ' s promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid were successful .  meanwhile ,  lse shareholders fear that deutsche boerse ' s control over its clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation .  this would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings .  lse and euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations ,  a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive .  the german group ' s ownership of clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a london-frankfurt merger .  commentators believe deutsche boerse ,  which has now formally asked german authorities to approve its plan to buy the lse ,  may offer to sell clearstream to gain shareholder approval .  euronext ,  so far ,  has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the lse - europe ' s biggest equity market - into a deal .

__label__politics labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which ,  for those just returned from the planet galifray ,  is "looming" .  the slogan "britain forward not back"  ( no ,  it ' s not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords )  is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it ' s always there but we mostly stop noticing .  the word "britain" is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour .  "forward" is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and ,  along with "not back" ,  is set against a mushy pea green background .  as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared ,  it was all very post modern ,  or something .  great use of colour .  those ad men really do earn their money .  and ,  coincidentally ,  the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called "fagin" posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but ,  as election supremo alan milburn declared ,  "are doing a very good job" .  mr milburn ,  in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning ,  explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards .  "not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days , " he declared .  it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories .  nobody ,  he claimed ,  could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling .  they could ,  however ,  picture michael howard or ,  of course ,  tony blair doing it .  so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition ' s policies and past record .  and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign ,  he said .  "between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain ,  not overseas , " he promised .  "he will be leading the domestic debate from the front ,  listening ,  taking the flak . " so ,  let ' s get on with it then .

__label__tech a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action ,  warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson .  if it gets its way ,  the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament ,  lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them .  if the new law was about border controls ,  defence or even the new constitution ,  then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives .  sadly for those who will be directly affected ,  the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs ,  a topic that may excite the bloggers ,  campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain .  after all ,  how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions ,  and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention ?  yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu ' s ministerial councils ,  as seems likely ,  it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us .  many observers of the computing scene ,  including myself ,  think the results will be disastrous for small companies ,  innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement .  it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors '  use of really obvious ideas .  in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless amazon lets you ,  because they hold the patent on "one-click" online purchase .  it is a small invention ,  but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it .  we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here ,  but perhaps not for long .  the new proposals go back to 2002 ,  although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s .  they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made ,  endorsed by the council of ministers ,  radically modified by the european parliament and then re-presented in their original form .  some national governments seem to be aware of the problems .  poland has rejected the proposal and germany ' s main political parties have opposed it ,  but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection .  early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals .  science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position ,  but according to those present ,  it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned .  the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an "a" item and can only be approved or rejected .  no discussion or amendment is allowed .  so why should we be worried ?  first ,  there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments .  this goes to the heart of the european project ,  and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried .  if coders are treated like this today ,  who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow ?  more directly ,  once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else ' s patent .  this is not about stealing software ,  as code is already protected by copyright .  patents are not copyright ,  but something much stronger .  a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention ,  even if the other person invented it separately .  i have never ,  to my shame ,  managed to read lord byron ' s childe harold ' s pilgrimage .  if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence .  the same does not hold for a patent .  if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files ,  then i am in trouble under patent law ,  at least in the us .  coincidence is no defence .  the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies ,  but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents .  they have legal departments and ,  more crucially ,  patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders .  even this system breaks down ,  of course ,  as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer  ( and other browsers )  infringed an eolas patent .  that one was eventually thrown out ,  but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars .  but small companies ,  and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade .  much of the really useful software we use every day ,  programs like the apache web server ,  the gnu / linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser ,  is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements .  the damage to software will not happen overnight ,  of course .  if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products .  eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly ,  probably with some secret funding from one or two large players .  the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas .  and it will damage europe ' s computer industry .  we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law .  bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital . 
__label__sport the united states kept the davis cup final alive with victory in saturday ' s doubles rubber ,  leaving spain 2-1 ahead going into the final day .  masters cup champions mike and bob bryan thrashed juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo 6-0 6-3 6-2 in front of a partisan crowd in seville .  victory would have given spain the title but they were outclassed .  in sunday ' s reverse singles ,  carlos moya takes on andy roddick before rafael nadal faces mardy fish .  "it feels good ,  but it ' s not going to be as good if we don ' t win two tomorrow , " said mike bryan .  "it feels good to give those guys another shot ,  and spain has to go to sleep on that . " bob bryan added: "i ' m really confident in andy winning that first match ,  and then anything can happen . " spain coach jordi arrese chose to rest 18-year-old nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over roddick on friday .  he was replaced by former world number one ferrero ,  but the spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world ' s best doubles teams .  the 26-year-old bryan twins have won all four of their davis cup matches this year .  and they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the olympic stadium ,  racing through the opening set to love .  the spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out .  when robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over ,  and the unflappable bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win .  ferrero ,  who was upset to be dropped for friday ' s singles ,  hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat .  "it was a difficult game against the best doubles players , " he said .  "they have everything calculated and we had very little to do .  "i was a bit surprised that i was named to play the doubles match because i hardly play doubles . " arrese said: "juan carlos hasn ' t played at all badly .  he played the right way but the bryans are great doubles players . "
__label__politics tony blair ' s feud with gordon brown is damaging the way the uk is governed ,  tory leader michael howard has claimed in a heated prime minister ' s questions .  mr howard asked: "how can they fight crime when they are fighting each other ? " that question was later unveiled as the headline for new tory campaign posters .  but mr blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people ' s priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by labour .  "he can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages ,  low inflation ,  low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to , " he said .  the chancellor is currently on a high-profile tour of africa to highlight new anti-poverty plans .  but before doing so ,  he insisted he still trusted mr blair ,  despite claims to the contrary in a new book .  brown ' s britain ,  by robert peston ,  says there is mutual animosity between the two men .  it claims mr blair said in november 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election .  but he went back on his pledge after support from cabinet allies and suspicion that mr brown was manoeuvring against him ,  it says .  mr peston ' s book claimed that mr brown told mr blair: "there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe . " mr blair directly denied that quote on wednesday .  he again insisted there could be no deals about the premiership but twice declined directly to say whether or not he had offered to quit .  the tory leader countered that such agreements had been struck twice at dinners with the chancellor .  he declared: "he is the deals on meals prime minister .  no wonder the chancellor is not a happy eater . " he continued: "how can there be discipline in schools when there is no discipline in government ,  how can they clean up our hospitals when they don ' t clean up their act ? " mr blair said he would not respond to "tittle tattle in books" and promised to hail labour ' s record on the economy ,  waiting lists and law and order "from now until polling day" .  later at their poster launch tory co-chairman liam fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how "juvenile" the prime minister and chancellor were .  labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on tuesday ,  where mr brown was joined by alan milburn ,  who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor .  but liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc news: "the government is clearly split at the top .  this kind of cosmetic exercise does not persuade anybody . " later this week mr blair is expected to outline the direction of his party ' s next election manifesto .  the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday ' s meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made mr peston ' s book . 
__label__sport ulster clung on for a morale-boosting celtic league win over bottom club borders at netherdale on friday night .  a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish ,  but the scottish side could not complete the fightback .  ulster had led 20-6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham .  but the irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table .  borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by charlie hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try .  calum macrae surrendered possession before centre steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone .  substitute joe pattison - who had come on for the injured gareth morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase .  the speedy steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time ,  giving adam larkin an easy conversion .  ally warnock clawed back three points for borders ,  but they were soon hit by another double-blow .  first ,  mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward .  larkin again added the extras .  even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break ,  the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin-binned .  the hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart ,  however ,  when warnock struck a penalty at the other end .  and he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale .  ulster coach mark mccall said he was delighted to get the victory .  "borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time , " said mccall .

"if i am to compete in it ,  it is only if i feel i can win , " said the 30-year-old ,  who is retiring in 2006 .  "otherwise there is not much point in me going . " el guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last august when he clinched his first olympic titles over 1500m and 5 , 000m .  but the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career .  the 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5 , 000m crown in helsinki this summer .  and he is aiming to break 10 , 000m olympic champion kenenisa bekele ' s 5 , 000m and 10 , 000m world records .  el guerrouj could meet bekele in march as the ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses .  but the moroccan will not commit himself to the st galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going .

__label__sport italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday ' s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter .  with both sides looking for their first win of the championship ,  the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider .  and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs .  "it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win , " said the lock forward .  italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000 ,  but two of those have come against scotland .  this year ,  italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17 .  however ,  they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out .  now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations .  "scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh , " said bortolami .  "we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs .  "as a nation ,  our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games . "

"creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against lg group if lg card is liquidated , " said yoo ji-chang ,  governor of korean development bank  ( kdb )  - one of the card firm ' s major creditors .  lg group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits .  it says it wants "fair and reasonable guidelines" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors ,  who now own 99 . 3% of lg card .  the creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets ,  kdb said .  analysts believe a compromise is likely .  "lg group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of lg card , " said kim yungmin ,  an equity strategist at dongwon investment trust management .  lg card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble .  the firm returned to profit in september 2004 ,  but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the korea stock exchange .  the exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running .  lg card ' s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm ,  which owes about $12 . 05bn .  "eventually ,  lg group will have to participate ,  but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions , " said mr kim .

"we just had to stick to our defensive pattern ,  trust ourselves and trust those around us .  all round it was fantastic . " ireland captain brian o ' driscoll ,  who scored his side ' s only try ,  said: "we are delighted ,  we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter .  "we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you ' ve just got to jump on the back of it . " ireland coach eddie o ' sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break .  "andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldn ' t see whether he was offside or not so i don ' t know how andy could have known , " said o ' sullivan .  "what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us .  "we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team .  "i think our try was very well worked ,  it was a gem ,  as good a try as we have scored for a while . " o ' sullivan also rejected robinson ' s contention england dominated the forward play .  "i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i don ' t know how that adds up to domination , " he said .  o ' driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title .  "this season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites '  tag , " he said .  "hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so .  "as for my try it was a move we had worked on all week .  there was a bit of magic from geordan murphy and it was a great break from denis hickie . "

"if the mpc  ( the bank of england ' s monetary policy committee )  were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and i ' m not predicting that they will - i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour , " he told a parliamentary lunch .  "this is a big change in our political culture . " during an interview with bbc radio 4 ' s today programme ,  mr balls said he was sure mr brown ' s budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy .  "i don ' t think we ' ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001 , " he said .  his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers '  skills .  his message to the chancellor was: "please don ' t give it away in any form of electioneering . " sir digby added: "i don ' t think he will .  i have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through .  stability is the key word - british business needs boring stability more than anything .  "we would say to him  ' don ' t increase your public spending ,  don ' t give it away .  but if you are going to anywhere ,  just add something to the competitiveness of britain ,  put it into skilling our people '  .

__label__tech a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer .  four people ,  two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users ,  successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes .  previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain .  the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .  "the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions , " said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane .  the research team ,  from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany ,  said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought .  the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which ,  meant no surgery or implantation was needed .  brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes .  complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer .  such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles ,  so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively .  "the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm ,  a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis , " said the researchers .  the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried .  although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall ,  the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated .  it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments .  some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques .  earlier this year ,  a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character .

"as the court has now qualified its opinion on the community accounts for a decade ,  it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of eu revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of eu resources . " it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003 ,  worth £38 . 5m  ( 52m euros )  ,  up from 831 cases worth £35 . 7m in 2002 .  at the same time ,  reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10 , 276 cases worth £808m to 8 , 177 cases worth £644m .  edward leigh ,  chairman of the commons public accounts committee ,  said britain had to set an example when it assumed the eu presidency .  "any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer ,  given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community , " he said .  "departments responsible for administering eu funds need to make sure that they ' re doing everything possible to weed out improper spending .  "the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity ,  and raise overall standards of financial management . " a spokesman for the european anti-fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao ' s assessment of fraud reporting .  "the quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state ,  and there is room for improvement , " spokesman jorg wojahn said .  he added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud ,  with the statistics studied by nao providing a "good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud" .

"i have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day , " said moya .  "all my energy has been focused on today .  "what i have lived today i do not think i will live again .

"some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way .  it helps me reach my goals if i am obsessed .  "it ' s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something . " spanish captain jordi arrese said: "charly played a great game .  it was his opportunity and he hasn ' t let us down .  "he had lost three times to roddick ,  and this was his day to beat him .  "he had been waiting years to be in this position . " spain ' s victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal ,  who beat roddick in the opening singles .  aged 18 years and 185 days ,  the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup .  "what a great way to finish the year , " said nadal afterwards .  us coach patrick mcenroe wants roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface .  "i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better . " "obviously it ' s unrealistic to say that we ' re going to just start playing constantly on clay ,  with the schedule .  "but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff , " said mcenroe .  roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of seville ' s olympic stadium .  "it ' s just tough because i felt like i was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world , " said the american .  "i had my chances and just didn ' t convert them .  the bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend .

__label__politics reports that tony blair is planning a snap general election for february 2005 have been described as "idle speculation" by downing street .  a spokesman said he had "no idea" where the reports in the sunday times and sunday telegraph had come from .  the papers suggest ministers believe the government could benefit from a "baghdad bounce" following successful iraq elections in january .  a british general election was last held in february in 1974 .  in that election ,  edward heath lost and failed to build a coalition with the liberals .  harold wilson took over and increased his majority later in the year in a second election the latest speculation suggests the prime minister favours a february poll in order to exploit his current opinion poll lead over conservative leader michael howard .  but that strategy could prompt criticism he was seeking to "cut and run" after less then four years of a parliamentary term .  the papers report that alan milburn ,  labour ' s head of elections strategy ,  has played a key role in the plan for a february election ,  which would include a new year advertising blitz .  new labour ' s campaign ,  both newspapers said ,  would be centred around the slogan "britain is working" .  a labour party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for mr blair ,  but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in february .  most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 may .  the last election was in june 2001 . 
__label__business uk house prices dipped slightly in november ,  the office of the deputy prime minister  ( odpm )  has said .  the average house price fell marginally to £180 , 226 ,  from £180 , 444 in october .  recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases ,  and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005 .  but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market ,  annual house price inflation is still strong ,  up 13 . 8% in the year to november .  economists ,  however ,  forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months .

__label__sport  ( after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1 )  john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal .  blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game .  drogba and kezman scored from close range before antonio nunez ' s header made for a tense finale .  it was an amazing climax which gave mourinho his first silverware as chelsea manager .  yet it was controversial too ,  after mourinho ' s sending off ,  apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the liverpool fans .  there was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute .  riise could not have connected any better with morientes '  cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past petr cech .  the goal ,  the quickest-ever in a league cup final ,  stunned a blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to newcastle and barcelona in the previous week .  the blues '  attacking chances were limited ,  and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard ' s powerfully-struck drive and drogba ' s low shot .  despite their frustration ,  chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break liverpool ' s well-organised defence .  joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore ,  but the reds reached half-time without any major scares .  the blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged liverpool back .  nevertheless ,  liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from dudek on 54 minutes ,  first at full stretch from gudjohnsen ' s header ,  then to smother william gallas '  follow-up .  and despite chelsea ' s possession ,  it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech .  and the blues '  increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last-ditch tackle .  but gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected ferrerira ' s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring chelsea level .  that prompted mourinho ' s reaction which saw him sent off ,  but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining .  dudek saved bravely at the irishman ' s feet ,  while milan baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time .  drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post .  but seconds after the half-time interval ,  drogba made no mistake ,  picking the ball up from glen johnson ' s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home .  and kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after gudjohnsen ' s cross in the 110th minute .  there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level ,  but despite liverpool ' s desperate attacks ,  chelsea clung on to win .  dudek ,  finnan ,  carragher ,  hyypia ,  traore  ( biscan 67 )  ,  luis garcia ,  gerrard ,  hamann ,  riise ,  kewell  ( nunez 56 )  ,  morientes  ( baros 74 )  .  subs not used: pellegrino ,  carson .  hyypia ,  traore ,  hamann ,  carragher .  riise 1 ,  nunez 113 .  cech ,  paulo ferreira ,  ricardo carvalho ,  terry ,  gallas  ( kezman 74 )  ,  jarosik  ( gudjohnsen 45 )  ,  lampard ,  makelele ,  cole  ( johnson 81 )  ,  drogba ,  duff .  subs not used: pidgeley ,  tiago .  lampard ,  kezman ,  drogba ,  duff .  gerrard 79 og ,  drogba 107 ,  kezman 112 .  78 , 000 s bennett  ( kent )  .

__label__entertainment historians in florida have discovered a 40-year-old clip of a clean-cut jim morrison appearing in a promotional film for his university .  the 1964 film shows the doors frontman ,  who died aged 27 in 1971 ,  playing the part of a young man who had been rejected by florida state university .  morrison is seen quizzing a college administrator on why he was refused .  "but what happened ?  how come my parents and the state and the university didn ' t look ahead ? " he is seen asking .  "it ' s incredible .  he ' s so clean cut and soft-spoken , " said florida state archivist jody norman .  "we know he was at florida state university for a period of time and he did some acting when he was there , " norman added .  the doors were one of the most influential bands of the 1960s ,  with hits including light my fire and riders on the storm .  morrison was notorious for his wild lifestyle - and was accused of exposing himself and simulating a sex act at a miami concert in 1969 .  he was found dead in the bath of his paris apartment and died from heart problems ,  aggravated by alcohol .  a coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes and his grave at the city ' s pere lachaise ceremony has become a shrine for fans . 
__label__sport dundee united eased into the semi-final of the scottish cup with an emphatic win over aberdeen .  alan archibald prodded united ahead in 19 minutes and james grady made it two from close range 10 minutes later .  richie byrne ' s header gave aberdeen a way back into the game ,  but stevie crawford restored united ' s lead from 18 yards before half time .  the scoring was completed by grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1 .  tony bullock in the united goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock .  noel whelan laid the ball off to jamie winter on the edge of the box ,  but his first-time effort was gathered by the united keeper .  moments later though ,  the home side took the lead .  barry robson whipped in a free kick from the right ,  which stevie crawford caught on the volley .  russell anderson failed to deal with it and whelan ' s clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of archibald ,  who poked the ball into the net .  united doubled their lead after 29 minutes when grady tapped the ball into an empty net after robson had headed mark wilson ' s cross off the angle of post and bar .  but only three minutes later aberdeen clawed their way back into the match .  a free kick from the left by winter was met powerfully by the head of byrne at the back post ,  leaving bullock helpless .  united restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half .  jason scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing crawford and he coolly beat ryan esson from 18 yards .  united ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval .  grady received a pass from crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch ,  he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of esson .  the home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from esson to keep out robson ' s drive after 62 minutes .  the keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later ,  beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area .  robson saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line .  bullock ,  duff ,  wilson ,  ritchie ,  archibald ,  scotland  ( samuel 63 )  ,  brebner ,  kerr  ( cameron 87 )  ,  robson ,  crawford ,  grady .  colgan ,  dodds ,  kenneth .  brebner .  archibald 19 ,  grady 29 ,  crawford 41 ,  grady 47 .  esson ,  hart ,  anderson ,  diamond ,  byrne  ( morrison 75 )  ,  mcnaughton ,  heikkinen  ( foster 27 )  ,  winter ,  clark  ( stewart 51 )  ,  mackie ,  whelan .  blanchard ,  mcguire .  : anderson ,  diamond .  byrne 33 .  8 , 661 k clark
__label__tech microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser .  the revamp has been prompted by microsoft ' s growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers .  microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals .  test versions of the new program ,  called ie 7 ,  are due to be released by the summer .  the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates ,  microsoft chairman and chief software architect ,  during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco .  although details were scant ,  mr gates ,  said ie7 would include new protections against viruses ,  spyware and phishing scams .  this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information .  in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6 ,  microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware .  earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser .  microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security .  one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program .  an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005 .  the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because ,  before now ,  microsoft said it had no need to update the browser .  typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system .  a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows ,  codenamed longhorn ,  which is due to appear in 2006 .  the current version of internet explorer is four years old ,  and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera .  there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox .  in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004 .  estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely .  according to market statistics gathered by websidestory ,  firefox ' s market share is now about 5% of all users .  however ,  other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15% .  some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser .  internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004 .

__label__business a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market .  the council of mortgage lenders  ( cml )  ,  british bankers association  ( bba )  and building societies association  ( bsa )  all said mortgage lending was slowing .  cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell .  elsewhere ,  the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by £4m in november ,  compared to october ' s £4 . 29m .  the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85 , 000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003 .  data from the cml showed lending fell to just over £25bn in november ,  from £25 . 5bn a year earlier .  separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year ,  at a seasonally-adjusted £2 . 98bn .  the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a "winter sale" and slash prices by up to 8% .  miles shipside ,  commercial director at rightmove ,  said sellers would have to be "more realistic with their asking prices" to tempt buyers .  the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190 , 329 in november to £189 , 733 in december ,  while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer .  rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago .  "even once the quieter holiday period is over ,  sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market .  in any business ,  excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices , " mr shipside said .  "the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling ,  even in the current market . " overall ,  asking prices have fallen 3 . 3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of £6 , 500 has been cut from an average property .  a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005 .  "what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market ,  but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole , " cml director general michael coogan said .  "it ' s a fairly consistent picture ,  showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again ,  which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market , " investec economist philip shaw said .  "however ,  the figures do suggest only a modest weakening ,  and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time ,  though a collapse is still unlikely . "
__label__politics he called it his "masochism strategy" in the run-up to the iraq war and now tony blair has signed up for another dose of pain .  the idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of "real" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras .  the theory is that talking to the great british public ,  even if they are the "great unwashed" ,  is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians .  it is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people ' s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury .  mr blair used the tactic before the iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election .  labour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin ,  "control freakery" and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own mps .  tony blair himself has said people complain he does not listen .  mr blair ' s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on five television throughout wednesday .  the trouble began on the wright stuff show ,  with maria hutchings marching up to him ,  saying "tony ,  that ' s rubbish" as she tried to complain about her autistic son ' s school being threatened with closure .  a few "don ' t worries" as mrs hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show .  but that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce .  writer neil coppendale ,  from west sussex ,  asked of the iraq war: "tens of thousands of innocent men ,  women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night ? " on immigration ,  london teacher diane granger said: "where are you going to put everyone ? " and can you imagine even jeremy paxman putting the question posed by brighton nurse marion brown: "would you wipe somebody ' s backside for £5 ? " mr blair tried to use the questioners '  first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems .  many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a pr stunt which backfired .  indeed there is a danger mr blair simply ends up looking "embattled" .  conservative michael howard and liberal democrat charles kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month .  labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence .  james humphreys ,  ex-head of corporate communications at number 10 ,  says the strategy shows frustration with the media .  "they feel they don ' t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion , " he says .  there are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls ,  he argues .  the prime minister knows full well the potential hazards  .  he must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with sharron storer ,  the birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign .  "all you do is walk around and make yourself known ,  you don ' t do anything to help anybody , " she told mr blair before stomping off ,  refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately .  former downing street media chief alastair campbell has described the episode as a "bit of a disaster" as it meant the launch of labour ' s election manifesto received little coverage .  but it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive ,  not least because it coincided with john prescott ' s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester .  former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public .  the undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was margaret thatcher discomfort on nationwide in 1983 ,  when viewer diana gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the belgrano in the falklands war .  john major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox .  it may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added "fizz" to his campaign .  in his memoirs ,  he also argues the strategy contrasted with neil kinnock ' s "contrived photo opportunities" and attempts at an artful campaign .  "he wanted to look like a prime minister .  i was prime minister and i wanted a flesh and blood fight , " says mr major .  mr blair told prospective labour mps on thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could "enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment" .  but he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips .  mr blair recalls how bill clinton once advised him: "always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day . " his hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for labour the old maxim: "no pain ,  no gain . "
__label__business european union finance ministers are meeting on thursday in brussels ,  where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax .  a levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world ' s poorest nations .  airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans ,  saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure .  the eu said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines .  it was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the "competitiveness of the airlines" .  ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing european public spending .  global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the g7 group and world economic forum .  the world ' s richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0 . 7% of their annual gross national income by 2015 .  many eu ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting .  at present ,  the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states .

"i wish i was playing for real madrid , " the 21-year-old told cadena cope .  "hopefully it could happen .  i love the way madrid play .  i ' m not happy with the way things are . " the striker joined the gunners from seville for £17m at the start of 2004 ,  but it has frequently been reported that he is homesick .  he began the season in superb form but has struggled to maintain his high standards as arsenal have gradually lost the premiership initiative to manchester united and chelsea .  "if i ' m not  ( playing for real )  i ' m going to have to carry on playing with some bad people , " he added .  "i ' m sure there are none in the real dressing room .  "i ' m happy madrid is interested in me because it has always been my dream since i was little to play there . " before the story surfaced ,  reyes had moved to play down reports linking him with the spanish giants ,  issuing a statement through arsenal describing the speculation as "flattering" .  "i have seen the stories in the media linking me with real madrid , " he had said on thursday lunchtime .  "but not only am i under contract at arsenal ,  i am happy here and committed to helping the team win more trophies . " butragueno ,  meanwhile ,  was angry at being impersonated by the radio disc jockey .  "it is a disgrace ,  there is no foundation to this , " he said .  "he is an arsenal player and we have to be respectful .  we have to be careful because of the rumours that appear in the news . "

"this is a historic moment in gaming history ,  and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau , " said marco behrmann ,  director of community relations at mindark ,  the game ' s developer .  the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property .  deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold .  he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes .  "this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming , " said deathifier .  the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped  ( project entropia dollars )  and back again into real money .  ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots  ( $5 )  and shogun armour  ( $1 . 70 )  gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods ,  buildings ,  and land in the entropia universe .  mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds .  almost 200 , 000 people are registered players on project entropia . 
__label__tech the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005 ,  delegates at the world ' s largest gadget show ,  in las vegas ,  have been told .  the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11% ,  while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important .  "everything is going digital , " kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association ,  told the bbc news website .  the consumer electronics show  ( ces )  featured the pick of 2005 ' s products .  "consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs] ,  digital radio ,  and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005 .  "all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry . " despite showing diversity ,  some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much "wow factor" as in previous years .  the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces ,  which was the "time and place shifting" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere ,  at any time .  at the start of last year ' s ces ,  the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004 .  that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players ,  personal video recorders and digital cameras .  it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice ,  with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed .  part of this has been the rise in spending power of the "generation x-ers" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them .  more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers ,  according to cea research .  hybrid devices ,  which combine a number of multimedia functions ,  were also in evidence on the show floor .  "a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it , " said stephen baker ,  a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group .  "some of these functions cost next to nothing to add . " as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs ,  several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders ,  such as microsoft chief bill gates .  despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate ' s pre-show speech ,  he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market .  he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices .  he disappointed some ,  however ,  by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console .  another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony ' s new portable games device ,  the psp ,  had at the show .  sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe .  it went on sale in japan before christmas .  there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details .  a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their "consumer technology" offering .  elsewhere at the show ,  there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens ,  including samsung ' s 102-inch  ( 2 . 6 metre )  plasma - the largest in the world .  industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005 ,  with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds .  with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage ,  like seagate ' s 5gb pocket sized external hard drive ,  which won an innovation for engineering and design prize .  more than 120 , 000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas ,  which officially ran from 6 to 9 january .

__label__entertainment preview performances of the £3m musical billy elliot have been delayed to give the child actors a less arduous rehearsal schedule .  director stephen daldry made the decision to re-schedule the previews to protect the young stars .  three boys will rotate the demanding role of ballet dancer billy ,  which requires them to sing ,  dance and act .  the show ' s opening night on 12 may at the victoria palace theatre in london remains unaffected by the changes .  preview performances will now be held on 14 ,  20 and 27 april .  "this is one of the most ambitious projects i have been involved with , " said daldry .  "the decision has been made to push back our preview performances in order to give our company ,  with a cast including 45 children ,  a little extra time so they are as fully prepared as possible . " he added: "the young billy elliots in particular ,  making their professional stage debuts in the west end ,  will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the production . " the three boys playing billy are james lomas ,  15 ,  george maguire ,  14 ,  and liam mower ,  12 .  the other major child parts will also be rotated between young actors .  such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage school in newcastle to train potential stars for the show .  child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week .  adult actors in the show include tim healy as billy ' s father and haydn gwnne as his dance teacher mrs wilkinson .  sir elton john has composed the music .  daldry directed the successful film version of billy elliot ,  adapted from lee hall ' s script .  both were nominated for oscars ,  alongside julie walters ,  who played billy ' s teacher .

__label__tech third-generation mobile  ( 3g )  networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services .  that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week .  fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service ,  says the global mobile suppliers association .  at 3gsm ,  siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data .  the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks .  the system is not available commercially yet ,  but motorola ,  the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker ,  held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa  ( high speed downlink packet access )  ,  a high-speed ,  high bandwidth technology available now .  early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second  ( mbps )  compared with less than 384 kilobits per second  ( kbps )  on standard 3g networks .  "high-speed downlink packet access  ( hsdpa )  - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips , " according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys .  a number of companies are developing the technology .  nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access .  the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers .  "while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps ,  practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks , " said dr alastair brydon ,  author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements .  "the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which ,  even at this lower rate ,  will more than double the capacity .  .  .  when compared to basic wcdma [3g] , " he added .  motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2 . 9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device .  but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution ,  data optimised  ( ev-do )  .  us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year .  we are "expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds , " said oliver valente ,  sprint ' s vice president for technology development ,  when the contract was announced .  as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year ,  sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies ,  nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0 . 3-0 . 5 megabits a second ,  and peak download rates of 2 . 4mbps .  mmo2 ,  the uk-based operator with services in the uk ,  ireland and germany ,  has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access  ( hsdpa )  standard .  using technology from lucent ,  it will offer data speeds of 3 . 6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network ,  and will eventually support speeds of up to 14 . 4mbps .  us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa ,  using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson .  siemens '  plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today ,  but christoph caselitz ,  president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: "by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015 ,  the need for transmission capacities for voice ,  data ,  image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10 . " siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae ,  instead of the usual one .  this enables a data transmission ,  such as sending a big file or video ,  to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band .  the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences .  but today ,  instead of connecting to the internet by slow ,  dial-up phone connection ,  many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0 . 5 megabits a second - must faster than 3g .  this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up .  if they aren ' t ,  those lucrative "power users" ,  such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks ,  reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators .  but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately .  siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory ,  it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials .  a commercial system could be as far away as 2012 ,  though siemens did not rule out an earlier date . 
__label__sport paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday .  back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics ,  where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10 , 000m .  bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race .   the ability to run a gruelling 26 . 2 miles relies largely upon an athlete ' s belief that they can do it .  every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it ,  "are you strong enough to finish ? " the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances .  sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence .  "there is an old adage ,   ' get straight back on the horse that threw you ,  ' " richards told bbc sport .  "paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens .  "she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running .  "if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness .  "she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment . "  for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york - win or lose .  if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong .  but if she fails to triumph ,  she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer .  and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship ,  appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues .  "athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions , " explains richards ,  who has worked with past olympians .  "she must not get caught up in someone else ' s agenda . " radcliffe ' s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york .  "she just thought ,   ' well ,  they can ' t think any worse of me now ,  ' " yelling told bbc sport .  "she ' s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it . "  radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as "impulsive" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals .  her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets ,  such as redemption .  "you can ' t change history , " warned richards .  "only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful .  "paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race . "  the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world .  it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better ,  with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs '  final reserves .  radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon .  "it ' s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again , " said yelling ,  herself a marathon runner .  "but that is only for long-term health and fitness .  "when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly .  so physically it is possible for paula . " richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe .  "the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens , " he said .  "and that just isn ' t going to be there in new york ,  that ' s been taken out of the equation . "  radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time .  and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage ,  starting in new york .  "how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not , " argues richards .  "one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities . " and yelling says: "i think this will probably make paula . " "i think it will drive her on and she ' ll come out of it a better athlete . "
__label__politics by any measure ,  new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else - a winner .  this is the man who ,  some pundits believe ,  was almost single-handedly responsible for bill clinton ' s sensational 1992 comeback victory .  but morris is no ideologue .  he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and ,  more recently ,  politicians from mexico to uruguay .  now he is back in london as the uk independence party ' s not-so-secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped - you guessed it - opposition candidate viktor yushchenko .  if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris ,  it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances .  that he enjoys the game more than the politics .  so why britain and why ukip which ,  despite its recent eu election successes ,  is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election .  on this subject ,  morris appears almost evangelical .  "i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and ,  coincidentally ,  so was ukip leader roger knapman .  "i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there" .  but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him ?  many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art ,  irrespective of the politics .  "i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism" .  a great soundbite ,  but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september .  "it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better ,  who don ' t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined .  "that ' s international bankers ,  the world trade organisation ,  the international monetary fund ,  the world bank and ,  primarily ,  the european union" .  so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic .  and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable .  "the tory party is schizophrenic about europe .  but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can ' t possibly re-negotiate anything  ( as michael howard is pledged to do )  .  "it ' s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying:  ' before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody ' " .  possibly a very american analogy ,  but another great soundbite .  "the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain - and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it" .  so is ukip ' s job to destroy the tories ,  as former member robert kilroy-silk once notoriously declared ?  "no .  the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories '  spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move .  "but it ' s not just to shift the tories .  i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair ' s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro" .  and ,  while we are on the subject of mr kilroy-silk ,  mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites .  "robert kilroy silk is not a team player - it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one" .  so what is the big plan for the general election .  how will he achieve the breakthrough ?  "look ,  we are not going to be forming the next government , " he said .  neither does ukip have to fight every seat .  as with the 2004 us presidential election ,  he says ,  the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in britain .  so ,  with limited resources ,  the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons .  he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll .  "the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs  ( individuals posting their views in online diaries )  .  people just did it" .  "anything can happen in the next general election .  there is an inherent instability at the moment .  "labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice" .  that might ,  he suggests ,  lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power .  it is a huge task ,  surely .  but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises - even while most still believe it is labour ' s for the taking .  ukip ' s performance in last year ' s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus .  and after all ,  he has a reputation to sustain .

__label__tech television started off as a magical blurry image .  then came the sharpness ,  the colour and the widescreen format .  now the tv set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future ,  although those in europe will have to be patient .  after years of buzz about high-definition tv  ( hdtv )  it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world ,  mainly the us and japan .  if you believe the hype ,  then hdtv will so wow you ,  that you will never want to go back to your old telly .  "hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers '  homes , " says jo flaherty ,  a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us .  all television images are made up of pixels ,  going across the screen ,  and scan lines going down .  british tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels .  by contrast ,  hdtv offers up to 1 , 080 active lines ,  with each line made up of 1 , 920 pixels .  the result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv .  but to get the full impact ,  programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them .  most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures .  viewers in japan ,  the us ,  australia ,  canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology ,  with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format ,  which includes 5 . 1 digital surround sound .  but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images .  many high-end european tv programmes ,  such as the recent athens olympics ,  are already being produced in high-definition .  but they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines .  the prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging .  according to consultants strategy analytics ,  only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008 .  but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change .  big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public ' s attention .  the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast in high-definition .  in the uk ,  satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 .  there is already a hdtv service in europe called euro1080 .  other european broadcasters ,  especially in france and germany ,  also aiming to launch similar services .  in britain ,  digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv ,  at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options .  the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal .  for now ,  broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans ,  although with no launch date in sight .  "the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right ,  and it would not be just a showcase ,  but a whole set of programming , " says andy quested ,  from the bbc ' s high-definition support group .  "we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010 ,  which would put us on the leading edge . " one of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web .  the bbc has already dipped its toe into this ,  including some hdtv content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for pcs .  it is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future .  according to mr quested ,  this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv .  this is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months ,  with the web eating into tv viewing habits . 
__label__sport the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou .  the high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation  ( segas )  last month .  now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport  ( cas )  and has suspended both athletes .  an iaaf statement said: "the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous . " the statement continued: "both athletes '  cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas .  the decision in both cases will be final and binding . " segas said the iaaf appeal was "expected" and "understandable . " "now we are going to await the final result ,  which we cannot prejudge , " said segas chairman vassilis sevastis .  kenteris ,  who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics ,  and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games .  however ,  the independent tribunal overturned those bans ,  clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv ,  chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics .  kenteris '  lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf ' s decision as "not unexpected" but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly .  "the iaaf ' s timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions , " said ioannidis .  "the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements ,  testimonies ,  the closing speeches of defence counsel .  .  .  and nine audio tapes .  "we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth . " kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer ' s olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august .  the pair then spent four days in a hospital ,  claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash .  it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair .  thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident
__label__business a batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the french economy ' s future prospects .  official figures showed on friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9 . 9% last month ,  while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in october .  at the same time ,  finance minister nicolas sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to french growth .  "[oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term ,  and potentially on confidence , " he said .  world oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand .  analysts said french companies ,  keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs ,  were reluctant to take on extra staff .  "[the unemployment figures] show the main problem of the french economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment , " said marc touati ,  an economist at natexis banques populaires .  "politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms ,  otherwise in five or ten years ,  it will be too late . " obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in france than in many other european economies .  many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs ,  and by scrapping restrictions on working hours .  the french statistics agency ,  insee ,  expects the economy to grow by about 2 . 4% this year ,  buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment .  that is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2% . 
__label__business the gap between us exports and imports hit an all-time high of $671 . 7bn  ( £484bn )  in 2004 ,  latest figures show .  the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24 . 4% above the previous record - 2003 ' s imbalance of $496 . 5bn .  the deficit with china ,  up 30 . 5% at $162bn ,  was the largest ever recorded with a single country .  however ,  on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 4 . 9% in december to £56 . 4bn .  the us consumer ' s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars ,  and even wine and cheese ,  reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush ' s economic policies .  democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices .  for example ,  they believe china ' s currency policy - which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given china ' s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors .  meanwhile ,  the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world ,  spurring on more demand for imported goods .  some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter .  but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets ,  which may in turn harm growth .  for all of 2004 ,  us exports rose 12 . 3% to $1 . 15 trillion ,  but imports rose even faster by 16 . 3% to a new record of $1 . 76 trillion .  foreign oil exports surged by 35 . 7% to a record $180 . 7bn ,  reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand .  imports were not affected by the dollar ' s weakness last year .  "we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend , " said economist marie-pierre ripert at ixis . 
__label__tech the last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs .  the count of known viruses broke the 100 , 000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50% .  similarly phishing attempts ,  in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data ,  are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated .  also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers ,  called bot nets ,  used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes .  one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus ,  said kevin hogan ,  senior manager in symantec ' s security response group .  although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code ,  said mr hogan ,  2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs .  the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology ,  he said .  his comment was echoed by graham cluley ,  senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos .  mr cluley said: "when the commercial world gets involved ,  things really get nasty .  virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum . " in particular ,  phishing attacks ,  which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers ,  boomed during 2004 .  web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching .  the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month .  those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity .  this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages .  "they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses , " said mr hogan .  "they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging . " the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky ,  bagle and mydoom mass mailers ,  but since then more surreptitious viruses ,  or worms ,  have dominated .  mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in "bot nets" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites .  in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active "bot computers" rose from 2 , 000 to 30 , 000 per day .  thanks to these "bot nets" ,  spam continued to be a problem in 2004 .  anti-spam firms report that ,  in many cases ,  legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages .  part of the reason that these "bot nets" have become so prevalent ,  he said ,  was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created .  in the past many viruses ,  such as netsky ,  have been the work of an individual or group .  by contrast ,  said mr hogan ,  the code for viruses such as gaobot ,  spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time .  the result is that now there are more than 3 , 000 variations of the spybot worm .

" the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004 .  in the past ,  threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild .  in june ,  the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology .  also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers ,  and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones .  on the positive side ,  finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture ,  arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers .  in total ,  eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced .  one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families .  also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers .

"investors wonder if yili ' s scandal ,  one of a slew to be uncovered this year ,  isn ' t just the tip of the iceberg , " said chen huiqin ,  an analyst at huatai securities . 
__label__politics tony blair is pressing the us to cut greenhouse gases despite its unwillingness to sign the kyoto protocol ,  downing street has indicated .  officials have confirmed climate change was discussed when influential senator john mccain recently visited mr blair .  climate change was an issue the prime minister "wanted to progress" during the uk ' s presidency of the g8 and eu in 2005 ,  said a spokesman .  but he played down reports mr blair was considering a new us-friendly treaty .  according to the times ,  the uk leader wants to end us isolation with a "kyoto-lite" agreement on the scale and nature of the threat from climate change .  he is said to have discussed the idea with mr mccain during his time at number 10 .  the prime minister is said to believe the united states '  refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on emissions is undermining other countries '  resolve to cut carbon dioxide production .  so far the us has refused to sign up to the kyoto treaty - which aims to cut emissions - branding it politically motivated and not based on science .  president bush ' s advisers have repeatedly denied global warming is taking place .  europe ,  which disputes the claim ,  has also signalled it wants to press ahead with talks about longer term climate change action in a way which involves both the united states and developing countries .  mr blair ' s reported treaty would also establish an international programme to develop technology needed for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions ,  says the times .  but there is still apparently "little prospect" of america agreeing to cut emissions ,  which could further provoke environmental campaigners already angry at the lack of progress .  mr blair was left blushing on wednesday when it emerged his manifesto target of a 20% cut to the 1990 greenhouse gas level by 2010 was set to be missed .

__label__tech still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year ' s sands of time ,  the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within ,  and in a more bellicose mood than last time .  this sequel gives the franchise a grim ,  gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence .  as before ,  you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective .  the time-travelling plot hinges on the dahaka ,  an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages .  the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast ' s creation .  studiously structured though this back story is ,  everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves ,  on the whole ,  as dependable as it needs to be .  ever since the series '  then-groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga ,  prince of persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves ,  that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies '  body parts .  those flashy moves are back in full evidence ,  and tremendous fun to perform and perfect .  combining them at speed is the best fun ,  although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill .  until you reach that point ,  it is a haphazard business .  all too often ,  you will perform a stunning triple somersault ,  pirouette off a wall ,  knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop ,  before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom .  that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance ,  for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path .  the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct ,  but combat is what is really been stepped up ,  and there is more of it than before .  the game ' s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways .  slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off .  warrior within is a very slick package; the game ' s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences .  it is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year ,  and when the game begins ,  it is something of an anti-climax .  that said ,  the graphics are excellent ,  and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game .  the music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off .  there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game .  perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be .  somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts ,  and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable .  but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy .  it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for . 
__label__politics ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve ,  work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned .  but he said replacing the controversial csa would be "the nuclear option" .  a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks .  chairman sir archy kirkwood said: "if the agency cannot be rescued ,  then it must be replaced . " the committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250 , 000 cases have yet to be processed .  it warned that it could be five years before the csa was "fit for purpose" ,  describing it as "a failing organisation" and "in crisis" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations .  the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans ,  including the "abandonment option" ,  to be presented to parliament by easter ,  in case the cs2 computer system could not be made to work .  and responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped ,  mr johnson told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme: "i certainly wouldn ' t rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system .  "but i think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn ' t going to work . " the mps launched their inquiry into the csa ' s performance after it became clear that ,  despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003 ,  a backlog of claims was building up .  the mps found the £456m system from american it giant eds was "nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied ,  disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate" .  faced with the committee ' s criticism ,  the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency ' s staff by 25% .  the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents .  it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m ,  while a further £947m has been designated as "unrecoverable" .  michelle ,  a mother of twins ,  said she had not received a penny of the £57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an "on-going battle" with the csa .  her forms have twice been lost in the post ,  she said .  "i don ' t receive correspondence ,  i don ' t receive phone calls ,  i have to chase them all the time , " she said .  theresa may ,  tory shadow work and pensions secretary ,  said: "we have got to find a way that ' s going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them . " the agency ' s former chief executive doug smith quit last autumn claiming he was "seriously disappointed" with its performance .  the committee said the national audit office should investigate why the eds system had gone so badly wrong .  it blamed the agency ' s senior management for a "multitude of problems" within the agency ,  including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff .

"it ' s a very ,  very competitive price point .  there are some innovative features ,  and nintendo has created quite a buzz , " he says .  "however ,  the line-up of games could have been stronger .  everyone wanted to see the eight-player mario kart ds ,  for example . " mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony ' s new psp ,  with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device .  "the psp is a sexy bit of kit ,  but sony ' s attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe ,  so far , " mr houlihan said .  the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2 . 6bn at the end of 2004 ,  according to industry analysts screen digest .  in the past ,  games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in europe than in other parts of the world .  however nintendo president satoru iwata said the company was "pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the us and european launch" .  "europe is an extremely important market for nintendo , " mr iwata added .  nintendo raised its sales targets for the ds console last december after selling a million in the us and japan in just a few weeks . 
__label__politics the reported feud between tony blair and gordon brown has prompted a labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds .  duncan bannatyne also attacked the government over iraq and its "poor" response to the asian tsunami crisis .  his broadside came as ex-foreign secretary robin cook said he hoped mr brown would be premier at some point .  mr bannatyne has previously given labour £50 , 000 .  he made his fortune from care homes and health clubs .  the 52-year-old on tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of cabinet disunity and international issues .  his spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give labour more money ,  although he would remain a supporter and not fund the conservatives .  robert peston ' s new book has prompted more speculation about the blair-brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down .  mr bannatyne said: "disunity in the cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country .  "gordon brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy ,  but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition . " the businessman ,  whose latest venture is a casino in newcastle ,  also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in iraq .  and he branded the uk government ' s response to the tsunami as "piecemeal and poor" .  "the people there need practical help not just pledges of money , " he said .  "the us has forces helping on the ground - we can do more . " british navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid .  mr bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on bbc2 business start-up programme dragon ' s den .  but his spokesman insisted his attack on labour was not a publicity stunt .  in a separate development ,  robin cook gave his support to mr brown ' s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be labour ' s election .  but he insisted the recent squabbles between mr blair and mr brown were not "perceived as a problem by the voters , " adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence .  mr cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was "not an alternative source of opposition to the government" .  he warned the "abstentions party" was the real challenge to labour - and they would not be motivated by mr blair ' s promise to produce an "unremittingly new labour" election manifesto .  his comments come after dave prentis ,  the leader of britain ' s biggest union unison ,  told the daily record newspaper he wants a date to be set for mr blair to be replaced as labour leader . 
__label__sport jamie costin should be paralysed .  he says so himself in a matter-of-fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the 50k walk .  there is an ironic chuckle as he talks of his immediate thoughts after a lorry ,  driving on the wrong side of the road ,  had ploughed into his rental car .  "i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken , " says the waterford man .  "but i was thinking maybe with a cortisone injection you never know .  "in my back ,  it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i ' d be able to race . " it took over 10 hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics .  "my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae ,  the bottom part had exploded so i ' m fierce lucky not be paralysed .  "i ' d fractured my big toe as well which was on the brake . " jamie didn ' t finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident .  "for the first nine hours ,  i had no pain killers which was ridiculous in 35 degrees heat .  "but once i got the scans and saw them it was a case of moving on and thinking: ' ok ,  i ' ve got a different set of circumstances now '  . " within three days he was arriving back in ireland by air ambulance .  doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie ' s back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home - something he is now very relieved about .  "the greek doctors were going to put three or four inch titanium rods either side of my spinal cord up through my vertebrae .  "that would have fused all my lower back and i would never have been able to race again .  they were really putting a lot of pressure on me to agree to the surgery .  "but when i got to the mater in dublin they said it was possible for it to heal totally naturally which is giving me the chance to get back into competition which is very important to me .  the people at the mater have been absolutely fantastic . " jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back .  he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 january .  "walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery . " physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery .  "johnston uses an advanced type of acupuncture and it ' s very effective .  "needles get put right close up to my spine .  a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and i ' m fairly incapacitated today as a result . " jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years .  "i was there for over a fortnight earlier this month and underwent a fair extreme treatment called cryotherapy .  "basically ,  there ' s a small room which is cooled by liquid nitrogen to minus 160 degrees centigrade and it promotes deep healing . " jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice-daily physio sessions and pool-work .  all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006 .  "it ' s all about trying to get mobility in my back .  lying down for three and a half months didn ' t really help with the strength .  "there ' s a lot of work involved in my recovery .  i ' m doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work .  "i ' m also going to the gym to lift very light weights to try and build up my muscles .  i ' m fairly full on with everything i do .  "i ' d hope to be training regularly by march .  but training is just part of the process of getting back .  "at the moment ,  every time i go and do a big bit of movement ,  my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up .  "it ' s a case of waiting and seeing how it reacts .  hopefully ,  after four or five months my back won ' t tighten up as much . "
__label__tech writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business ,  according to document security firm workshare .  up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed ,  a survey by the firm revealed .  to make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking .  the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding .  sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms ,  competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers ,  said andrew pearson ,  european boss of workshare which commissioned the research .  "the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too , " he said .  the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes .  as documents get passed around ,  worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents .  poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits .  microsoft ,  however ,  does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem .  "the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application , " says the instructions on microsoft ' s website .  microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document .  a tool for apple machines running word is not available .  workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that ,  on average ,  31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category .  often ,  said mr pearson ,  this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared .  however ,  the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved .  few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed .  the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if ,  for instance ,  those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated .  the research revealed that a document ' s metadata could be substantial as ,  on average ,  only 40% of contributors '  changes to a document make it to the final draft .  problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite ,  said mr pearson . 
__label__politics a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government ' s anti-terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name .  ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful .  he was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists .  five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign .  mr macdonald told bbc news: "the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion .  "the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community .  "i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally" .  under the anti-terrorism ,  crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks ,  foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial .  but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury .  "my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury ,  a proper criminal trial with proper accusations .  "as far as i ' m concerned ,  the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this . " he added .  the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday .  according to the independent ,  his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - nicholas blake qc ,  andrew nicol qc ,  manjit singh gill qc ,  rick scannell and tom de la mare .  they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission  ( siac )  - a secure court without a jury ,  which tries terror suspects .  mr macdonald said he had "no idea" whether further resignations would follow .  but barry hugill ,  a spokesman for the campaign group liberty ,  told radio 4 ' s today programme that more lawyers may go .  "i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning , " he said .  "they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in ,  the right to trial by jury ,  has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights . " helena kennedy ,  a labour peer and a human rights lawyer ,  said the special advocates '  main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees .  "when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review , " she said .

__label__sport a brave defensive display ,  led by keeper david james ,  helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea .  after a quiet opening ,  james denied damien duff ,  jiri jarosik and mateja kezman ,  while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas '  header off the line .  robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide .  chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard ' s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player ' s volley wide .  city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season .  and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat .  indeed ,  it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace .  shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball ,  which was blocked by john terry .  but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances .  first ,  duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman ,  who turned the ball wide .  soon afterwards ,  jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard ' s corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over .  chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman ' s fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas '  header from duff ' s corner .  city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal .  wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city ' s lone man up front ,  left free by terry ' s slip ,  contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain .  the second half started as quietly as the first ,  although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen ' s path .  there was a nasty moment for petr cech ,  looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league ,  when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper .  another quiet spell followed ,  which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt .  lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs .  another timely challenge ,  this time from richard dunne in time added on ,  prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot .  there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard ' s volley round the post .  cech ,  paulo ferreira ,  gallas ,  terry ,  bridge ,  jarosik  ( tiago 56 )  ,  lampard ,  makelele ,  duff ,  gudjohnsen ,  kezman  ( cole 63 )  .  subs not used: johnson ,  smertin ,  cudicini .  makelele ,  gudjohnsen .  james ,  mills ,  distin ,  dunne ,  thatcher ,  shaun wright-phillips ,  bosvelt ,  barton ,  sibierski  ( mcmanaman 85 )  ,  musampa ,  fowler .  subs not used: macken ,  weaver ,  onuoha ,  jordan .  bosvelt .  42 , 093 h webb  ( s yorkshire )  .

__label__politics hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut ,  but not to the same extent as those in england .  welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by march 2006 ,  against a current target of 18 months .  but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for march 2006 .  the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop .  this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme ,  which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales .  details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year .  in england ,  the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months .  dr richard lewis ,  welsh secretary of the british medical association  ( bma )  ,  welcomed the new targets "to make further and faster progress on waiting lists" .  "however ,  much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england , " he said .  "capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients don ' t receive a worse service than patients over the border . " health analyst tony beddow ,  from the welsh institute for health and social care ,  called the new targets "reasonably impressive" .  on wednesday ,  ms hutt also announced £264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times ,  improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales .  ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting "unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year" .  "we are turning the corner on long waits in wales .  now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again , " she said .  she added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant .  "but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months ,  and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long . " rhodri glyn thomas ,  plaid cymru health spokesman said: "it ' s exactly the same target she set in 1999 ,  with the qualification that it ' s dependent on a second offer .  it ' s a failed target ,  from a failed minister .  . with a failed policy .

" conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said: "we ' re spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof .  "the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively ,  and that ' s quite a criticism .

__label__business one of the world ' s largest manufacturers of hiv / aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer african countries - back into europe for resale at far higher price .  the company ,  glaxosmithkline ,  is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills ,  currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement .  it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way .  this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies .  they want to maintain their profits ,  but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-aids drugs to the world ' s poorest nations .  the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv-positive africans through their government ' s health care systems .  but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price .  glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging ,  then this trade can be substantially reduced .  the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit ,  as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade .  glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe .

"in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats ,  such as betamax and vhs ,  that consumers have seen in the past , " said ian fogg ,  personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research .  "the difference is that it is very fragmented , " he said .  "it ' s not a two-horse race ,  it ' s a five ,  six ,  seven or even eight-horse race" mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own .  he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families .  although initiatives such as microsoft ' s "plays for sure" program could help remove some of the uncertainty ,  he said ,  life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come .  shelley taylor ,  analyst and author of a report about online music services ,  said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers .  apple ' s itunes service was a perfect example of this ,  she said .  "although itunes has been hugely successful ,  apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods , " she said .  she said rampant competition between online music services ,  of which there are now 230 according to recent figures ,  could drive more openness and freer file formats .  "it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run , " she said ,  "and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest . " ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop .  "people want portability , " she said ,  "and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability . " cory doctorow ,  european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues ,  expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims .  "not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying , " he said .  he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy .  instead ,  said mr doctorow ,  drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers .  "the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version ,  the auto version ,  the american and uk version ,  the ringtone version ,  and so on . "
__label__politics plans to shed 71 , 000 civil service jobs will prove to be a "false economy" that could hamper public sector reforms ,  according to a tuc report .  public and commercial services union members have already voted to strike over cuts for one day on 5 november .  the tuc said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the £22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms .  general secretary brendan barber warned the "costs could easily outweigh the benefits" .  "the government ' s big boost to public spending is now showing results , " said mr barber .  "public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy .  "they may shoot a tory fox ,  but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms .  the costs could easily outweigh the benefits .

" marca refers in passing to the booing of england ' s black players - but only after referring to the cheers of "ole" which greeted the long periods of spanish possession .  aragones '  "no comment" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted ,  as marca focuses on the spanish coach ' s praise for his players .  serbia & montenegro ' s 2-0 world cup qualifying win in belgium - which could make qualification tougher for spain - seems to be of greater importance .  elsewhere ,  the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue .  "were there racist chants against some players ?  this hasn ' t happened in the spanish league and spain for many years , " said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido .  "so you  ( english reporters )  should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this . " and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones .  "perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue , " the paper says .     "what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd .  .  .  rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him . " yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants ,  with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes .  ashley cole ' s treatment of joaquin ,  and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their "ugliness" .  marca ' s headline says it all: "wayne rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el bernab&#233;u  ( wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu ) " rooney ' s display alarms the writer ,  in particular three "chilling" fouls on joaquin ,  casillas and marchena ,  which "could well have left them in the infirmary . " and like as ,  marca criticises gary neville for "leaving a message on reyes '  ankle" to remind him of the manchester united-arsenal clash this month .     spain ' s first-half performance is showered with praise ,  with xavi singled out as the biggest star .  "xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona , " the paper beams ,  adding ,  "what a work-rate ,  what dynamism ,  what vision ,  what leadership ,  what a midfield player ! " on a controversial evening ,  as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: "spanish football players played better football than the english . " more plaudits are given to the home team ,  with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which "spain dominated england with order and quality" .  the paper adds: "the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition .

__label__politics scotland ' s justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them "where it hurts most" by banning them from matches .  cathy jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the scottish executive campaign against sectarianism .  she praised celtic and rangers for their work in tackling the problem .  however ,  the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with old firm matches is a key objective .  ms jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round scottish cup clash between the glasgow clubs at parkhead on sunday .  the sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive .  last week ms jamieson and first minister jack mcconnell met supporters '  representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue .  they plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs ,  church leaders ,  senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited .  speaking on bbc radio scotland ' s sunday live programme ,  ms jamieson described friday ' s meeting as "very productive" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim .  ms jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a "trigger" for tensions and violence .  clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters '  groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem .  ms jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers .  she said: "we can ' t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence .  "that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that ' s the kind of thing supporters '  groups are very clear they don ' t want to be part of either ,  and they will work with us to try and deal with that .

"we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top ,  who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches ,  to be able to stop them attending the games .  "that ' s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games , " she said .  praising celtic and rangers for their efforts ,  she said: "i don ' t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs .

__label__tech a proposed european law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the european commission  ( ec )  despite requests by meps .  the law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year .  some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions ,  while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review "all aspects of the directive" .  the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect ,  in other words ,  "computer implemented invention" .  in a letter ,  ec president jos&#233; manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament ,  josep borrell ,  that the commission "did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council  ( of ministers ) " as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004 .  if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament .  but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive .  most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law .  french green mep alain lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the commission ignored the parliament ' s request it would be an "insult" to the assembly .  he said that the parliament would then reject the council ' s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure .  in the us ,  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted .  this means that the us-based amazon . com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service ,  for example .  critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in europe .  this ,  they fear ,  could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court .  supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing eu laws in line with the us .

__label__business a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice .  the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name .  the commission ' s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne .  but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term ,  with the cheese produced widely outside greece .  the commission ' s controversial 2002 ruling gave "protected designation of origin" status to feta cheese made in greece ,  effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there .  from 2007 onwards ,  greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products .  the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years .  "in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese , " hans arne kristiansen ,  a spokesman for the danish dairy board ,  told the bbc .  denmark is europe ' s second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about 30 , 000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece .  it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie .  "it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation , " mr kristiansen said .  "that is just one of the costs . " the case will also have a major impact on britain ' s sole feta producer ,  yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses .  judy bell ,  the company ' s founder ,  said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product .  "if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation , " she said .  "we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone ' s eyes - it ' s very clear from the label that it ' s yorkshire feta . " the original decision was a victory for greece ,  where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6 , 000 years .  feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat ' s milk ,  and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine .  greece makes 115 , 000 tonnes ,  mainly for domestic consumption .  the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn .

"while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago ,  people seem to not have fully absorbed this development ,  though they are personally experiencing its effects , " said pipa director steven kull .  "people around the world are saying:  ' i ' m ok ,  but the world isn ' t '  .

" the government is holding a further meeting on friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the british board of film classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer .  ms hewitt said: "adults should be treated as adults and children as children .  it is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors .  "equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children .  "video games are different to films or videos ,  and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do .  "we need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement .

"so you shouldn ' t let them play an 18-rated game .  it ' s the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices ,  but children can ' t always and need to be protected .

__label__business soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment ,  one of the world ' s leading credit rating agencies says .  standard & poor ' s has classed russian bonds as "investment grade" ,  up from their former "speculative" rating .  russia ' s reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos .  s&p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk .  russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor .  gold and foreign currency reserves of $119bn beat its foreign public debt of some $113bn .  the other two major ratings agencies - fitch and moody ' s have long since upped their rating of russia ' s sovereign debt .  s&p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms .  now ,  though ,  it has finally followed suit .  but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past .  instead ,  with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales ,  s&p said the government ' s own debt is looking a good bet .  "these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia , " wrote s&p credit analyst helena hessel .  the yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes .  the company ' s founder and ex-chief executive ,  mikhail khodorkovsky ,  is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud .  many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin .  his company ,  meanwhile ,  is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlin ' s wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control . 
__label__business german football club and former european champion borussia dortmund has warned it will go bankrupt if rescue talks with creditors fail .  the company ' s shares tumbled after it said it has "entered a life-threatening profitability and financial situation" .  borussia dortmund has posted record losses and missed rent payments on its westfallen stadium .  chief executive gerd niebaum stepped down last week and creditors are now pushing for greater control .  shares in borussia dortmund ,  germany ' s only stock-market listed football club ,  dropped by almost 23% to 2 . 05 euros during early afternoon trading .  fund manager florian hamm - borussia dortmund ' s largest investor - said he would only invest more money in the company if he got a greater say in how it is run .  "i demand better transparency , " he is quoted as saying by germany ' s manger magazin .  the club has also faced calls to appoint executives from outside the club .  borussia dortmund posted a record loss of 68m euros  ( $89m; £47m )  in the 12 months through june .  it made a loss of 27 . 2m euros in the first half of the current fiscal year and said that total debts will increase to 134 . 7m euros by the middle of 2006 unless a restructuring plan is pushed through .  "this is the bill for their mismanagement over the past years , " said hvb analyst peter-thilo halser .  the club appointed an auditor ,  who has recommended a number of steps ,  including deferring the rent due on the stadium and suspending debt repayments until at least the 2006-2007 fiscal year .  stephen schechter ,  a uk investment banker who has held talks with borussia dortmund over a possible bond sale ,  said the club needs a capital injection of 35m euros .  "they need strong people on the board who do not have a history with the club , " he said . 
__label__business the two most senior executives at us mortgage giant fannie mae have resigned after accounting irregularities were uncovered at the company .  chief executive franklin raines ,  a former senior official in the clinton administration ,  and chief financial officer tim howard have left the firm .  fannie mae was criticised by financial regulators and could have to restate its earnings by up to $9bn  ( £4 . 6bn )  .  it is america ' s second largest financial institution .  recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at fannie mae ,  which supplies funds to america ' s $8 trillion mortgage market .  last week ,  the firm was admonished by the securities and exchange commission which said it had made major errors in its financial reporting .  the financial regulator said fannie mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet .  analysts said the sec ' s criticism made it impossible for fannie mae ' s senior executives to remain .  mr raines ,  head of the office of management and budget under president clinton ,  has taken early retirement while mr howard has also stepped down ,  the company said on tuesday .  kpmg ,  fannie mae ' s independent auditor ,  will also be replaced .  "by my early retirement ,  i have held myself accountable , " mr raines said in a statement .  fannie mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans .  as a result ,  it could be forced to restate $9bn in earnings over the past four years ,  effectively wiping out a third of the company ' s profits since 2001 .  although not making loans directly to buyers ,  fannie mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market ,  underwriting half of all us house purchases .  the firm operates under charter from the us congress .  it has faced stinging criticism from congressional leaders who held hearings into its finances earlier this year and from government regulator ,  the office of federal housing enterprise oversight  ( ofheo )  .  "we are encouraged that the board ' s announcement signals a new culture and a new direction for fannie mae , " armando falcon ,  ofheo director said .  the problems afflicting fannie mae are just the latest to hit the us mortgage industry .  freddie mac ,  the country ' s other largest mortgage firm ,  was forced to restate its earnings by $4 . 4bn last year and pay a $125m fine after an investigation of its books . 
__label__business turkey has agreed a draft proposal with the international monetary fund to borrow $10bn  ( £5 . 19bn )  ,  extending its ongoing financial support until 2007 .  turkey ' s current $18 . 6bn loan agreement with the imf expires in february and the new deal would see it receive added support between 2005 and 2007 .  in return for the funding ,  turkey would be expected to keep inflation under control and introduce market reforms .  turkey ' s economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001 .  economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years ,  ahead of imf forecasts ,  while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years .  however ,  turkey has a huge debt burden - already owing $23bn to the imf - while its current account deficit has swelled to $10 . 7bn this year .  the turkish economics minister ,  ali babacan ,  said the two sides had reached general agreement on a new three year funding program .  rodrigo de rato ,  the imf ' s managing director ,  said the loan agreement would help to improve turkish economic prospects by cutting its debt and stimulating growth .  "i believe the new programme ,  if implemented successfully ,  will help turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation ,  reduce inflation toward european level and enhance the economy ' s resilience , " he said .  the agreement must still be ratified by imf directors at a meeting expected to take place next month .  the agreement would also enable turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3 . 7m until 2006 .  as part of the draft agreement ,  turkey has signed a "letter of intent" stating its determination to push through far-reaching reforms to its tax and benefits system and its banking sector .  such reforms are considered vital for turkey if it is to fulfil its ambition of joining the european union .  the eu will decide on 17 december whether to begin entry talks with turkey .  the us ,  the largest of the imf ' s 184 members ,  is a strong supporter of continued financial support for turkey .

__label__tech the body that oversees how the net works ,  grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years ,  but it is just the start .  "in a sense ,  we have hardly started in reaching the whole population , " the new chair of the internet engineering task force  ( ietf )  ,  brian carpenter ,  says .  the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net ' s architecture .  with broadband take-up growing ,  services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net .  "i think voip  ( voice-over internet protocol ,  allowing phone calls to be made over the net )  is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms , " says dr carpenter .  "second ,  it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure .  with voip ,  you need very little infrastructure . " a distinguished ibm engineer ,  dr carpenter spent 20 years at cern ,  the european laboratory for particle physics .  as the new chair of the ietf ,  his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6 ,  the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web .  at cern ,  dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web ,  so he is well-placed to take on such a task .  the net ' s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols ,  and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf .  the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work ,  are open and free for anyone to use and work with .  the net is built on a protocol called tcp / ip ,  which means transmission control protocol ,  and internet protocol .  when computers communicate with the net ,  a unique ip address is used to send and receive information .  the ietf is a large international community of network designers ,  operators ,  vendors ,  and researchers working on the evolution of the net ' s architecture and the way this information is sent and received .  they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps .  "we ' ve seen some interesting effects over last few years , " explains dr carpenter .  "the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s .  then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000 .  "we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth . " that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies ,  like china ,  which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies .  the number of broadband subscribers via dsl  ( digital subscriber line )  doubled in a year to 13 million ,  according to figures released at the end of 2004 .  "the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate , " explained dr carpenter .  "given it [the net] was designed for the whole community ,  it has done well to reach millions .  if you want to reach the whole population ,  you have to make sure it can scale up . " ipv6 ,  the standard that will replace the existing ipv4 ,  will allow for billions more addresses on the net ,  and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world .  "the actual number of addresses with ipv4 is limited to four billion ip addresses .  "that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve ,  so there is technical solution ,  the new version of ip - ipv6 .  "it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits , " said dr carpenter .  standards are vital to something as complex as the net ,  and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task .  the difference this next generation standard ,  ipv6 ,  will make to the average net user is almost invisible .  "our first goal is that it [ipv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference .  "it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer .  a lot of the process will be invisible .  "people are usually given an ip address without knowing it . " technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled ,  said dr carpenter .  the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security .  to dr carpenter ,  the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour .  people have to be educated about "sensible behaviour" he says ,  such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something .  "i don ' t think it is going to get worse .  people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street .  "we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards .  it is a never-ending battle in a sense . " but ,  he adds: "even if security has improved ,  you still worry a bit .  unfortunately ,  it is just part of life .  we have a duty to do what we can . "

__label__politics the tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control ,  despite backing a law change last year .  spokesman david davis said ministers had failed to make his party aware of concern among senior police that plans would cause more anti-social behaviour .  notts police chief steve green said innocent people would suffer .  but culture secretary tessa jowell said a delay would be "disastrous" and she accused the tories of opportunism .  the government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking ,  she added .  earlier chief constable green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises .  "if you look at the market square in nottingham ,  if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of ? " he asked on bbc radio 4 ' s world at one programme .  he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night .  earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an "epidemic" of binge drinking .  minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises .  it is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once .  earlier tony blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers .  "my view of this is very clear: we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and don ' t show the responsibility , " he told mps .  "the law-abiding majority who want the ability ,  after going to the cinema or theatre say ,  to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced ,  we shouldn ' t have to have restrictions that no other city in europe has ,  just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol ,  who go out and fight and cause disturbances .  "to take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not ,  in my view ,  sensible . " this week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding "urban savages" and turning town centres into no go areas .  judge charles harris qc made his remarks as he sentenced three men for assaults carried out while drunk and high on drugs after a night out .

"ripguard is designed to .  .  .  reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer , " said the firm .  macrovision said the new technology will work in "nearly all" current dvd players when applied to the discs ,  but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard .  some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux .  the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales .  the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months ,  taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download .  "ultimately ,  we see ripguard dvd .  .  .  evolving beyond anti-piracy ,  and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions ,  interoperability in tomorrow ' s digital home ,  and the upcoming high-definition formats , " said steve weinstein ,  executive vice president and general manager of macrovision ' s entertainment technologies group .  macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against "rent ,  rip and return" - where people would rent a dvd ,  copy it and then return the original .  ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005 ,  the company said .  the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used ,  those programs will now most likely crash ,  the company said .  macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures .

"these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground , " she warned .  outlining his crime manifesto ,  mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates .  "the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have , " he told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme .  "the trouble is ,  and it ' s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are . " mr howard said the authorities were not "providing the local accountability that we want to see" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible .  critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community .  lord harris ,  who sits on the executive of association of police authorities ,  said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician .  "that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions , " he said .  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and "could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials" .  mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a "minimum policing guarantee" with their chief constables .  a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard ' s record ,  saying police numbers had fallen by 1 , 132 when he was home secretary .  he said: "today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them ,  other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system .

__label__politics tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans ,  saying they are a "ludicrous improbability" .  the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure .  tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut £35bn in "wasteful" spending to allow £4bn in tax cuts .  on saturday ,  tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing "inefficiencies" which had "burgeoned" under labour .  in his speech ,  mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party ,  which had learned to occupy the political centre ground ,  with a hidebound tory party ,  which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts .  mr blair said: "the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk ,  both britain ' s hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages ,  inflation ,  unemployment ,  for decades - and the key investment in public services .  "i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it ' s possible to imagine , " he said .  "it ' s a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government . " mr blair added: "they ,  the conservatives have learned nothing . " by contrast ,  he said ,  new labour had listened to its electorate and changed .  mr blair went on to list his government ' s achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party .  "so now we have a choice ,  we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back .  and i say we have to fight . " in response ,  david davis said the tories would make cuts ,  such as removing regional assemblies ,  but would bring in more police officers and match labour ' s spending on health and education .  "everybody knows ,  having lived through this government the last seven years ,  that they faced lots of stealth tactics ,  lots of increases in taxes ,  but no improvement in public services , " he said .  mr davis said labour had been responsible for "huge waste ,  huge overspending ,  not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy" .  "the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government ,  less waste and lower taxes with a tory government , " he concluded .  gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors .  the chancellor said the conservatives '  plans would see some £50bn in spending cuts by 2011 ,  which the tories deny .  mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be "distracted or diverted" .  according to an advance text released by officials ,  he told delegates: "we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them . " mr brown warned that the tories were planning "the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto" .  meanwhile ,  tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of "misrepresenting" the party ' s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans .  "he still cannot accept the simple truth ,  which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools ,  hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes , " mr letwin said .  "once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the £8bn shortfall in their plans ? "

"we are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared , " said nationwide economist alex bannister .  there have been a number of warnings that the uk housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004 .  in november ,  barclays ,  which owns former building society the woolwich ,  forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005 ,  followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007 .  and last summer ,  economists at pricewaterhousecoopers  ( pwc )  warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009 .  the price of an average uk property now stands at £152 , 879 .  homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months ,  mr bannister said .  he said if the growth continued at this level then the bank of england may increase interest rates from their current 4 . 75% .  "i think the key is what the bank expects to happen to the housing market .  we always thought we would see a small rise ,  they thought they would see a small decline . " house prices have risen 0 . 9% this year ,  nationwide said ,  and if this pace of increase persists ,  prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to december .  this is slightly above the 0-5% range nationwide predicts .  further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from bank of england lending figures released on tuesday .  new mortgage loans in january fell to 79 , 000 from 82 , 000 in december ,  the bank said .  the past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995 .  the bank revealed that 48 , 000 fewer mortgages were approved in january than for the same month in 2004 .  overall ,  mortgage lending rose by £7 . 2bn in january ,  marginally up on the £7 . 1bn rise in december . 
__label__entertainment three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year ' s oscars were british .  for andrea arnold ,  who won the category ,  ashvin kumar and gary mckendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight .  arnold ' s gritty drama wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline ,  while kumar ' s little terrorist follows a young pakistani muslim boy ,  who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed indian border .  mckendry ' s entry ,  everything in this country must ,  forces british soldiers and catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in northern ireland .  last week ,  the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the academy ' s headquarters in beverly hills .  "i felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen i ' ve ever seen , " says arnold .  set in her native dartford ,  wasp tells the story of a young mum ,  who ,  unable to find a babysitter ,  leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she ' s on a date .  the image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby ' s mouth .  "the other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say .  but i just start with an image i can ' t shake off ,  work outwards from that and see what comes out , " she explains .  since she presented children ' s tv shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s ,  arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention .  "i ' m not interested in the publicity .  it ' s not my personality .  i ' m overwhelmed by all the fuss , " she said .  "it ' s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different .  "but even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide  ( including one at sundance last month )  ,  i ' d still be proud of it - even if it hadn ' t won any . " asked what the nomination means to her ,  arnold says she feels "flattered and honoured" .  "we ' ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can ' t get it in perspective yet .  i ' m still reeling . " and she won ' t commit to an opinion of hollywood yet .  "i ' m just in the middle of it ,  living moment to moment ,  day to day . " but despite her reservations about the academy awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it ,  she accepts that it has opened doors for her .  "people will definitely listen to what i want to do now ,  and the phone didn ' t stop ringing for a week after i got nominated . " as for the future ,  arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films .  "you ' re left more to your own devices ,  without people interfering as much . " that said ,  she is currently working on a feature film with dogville and dancer in the dark director lars von trier . 
__label__tech the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago .  back in 1994 ,  yahoo had only just launched ,  most websites were text-based and amazon ,  google and ebay had yet to appear .  but ,  says usability guru dr jakob nielsen ,  some things have stayed constant in that decade ,  namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use .  dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today .  "roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today , " he said .  "some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed . " some design crimes ,  such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit ,  and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared ,  said dr nielsen .  "but there ' s great stability on usability concerns , " he told the bbc news website .  dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability ,  centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site ' s total design ,  were as important as ever .  "it ' s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such , " he said .  they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would .  "a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off , " he said .  "but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband . " dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google ,  amazon ,  ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important .  "those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful , " said dr nielsen ,  adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net .  "all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet , " he said .  "they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user .  "none of them have a fancy or glamorous look , " he added ,  declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied .  in the future ,  dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online .  "they are becoming like the operating system to the internet , " he said .  but ,  he said ,  the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better .  currently ,  he said ,  search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries .  often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not .  tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results .  research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines .  the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that ,  on average ,  they use 2 . 2 terms .  in 1994 only 1 . 3 words were used .  "i think it ' s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms , " said dr nielsen .  you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme ,  go digital
__label__business companies fail to draw up plans to cope with hiv / aids until it affects 20% of people in a country ,  new research says .  the finding comes in a report published on thursday by the world economic forum ,  harvard and the un aids agency .  "too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats , " said dr kate taylor ,  head of the wef ' s global health initiative .  nearly 9 , 000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for business and hiv / aids: commitment and action ?  dr taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as "too little ,  too late" .  the issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the world economic forum ,  which meets in davos ,  switzerland ,  next week .  the wef report shows that despite the fact that 14 , 000 people contract hiv / aids every day ,  concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months .  most  ( 71% )  have no policies in place to address the disease .  nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of hiv among their staff .  the un programme tackling aids ,  unaids ,  pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with hiv / aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible .  one company that does have a plan is anglo-american ,  the international mining company ,  which estimates an hiv prevalence of 24% among its 130 , 000-strong southern african workforce .  over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for hiv infection ,  coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to aids .  over 90% of the 2 , 200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work .  "effective action on hiv / aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations , " said brian brink ,  senior vice-president ,  health ,  at anglo-american .  "companies should encourage all workers to know their hiv status ,  making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol , " he said .  "providing access to treatment is a critical part of this . " across sub-saharan africa ,  even in countries with an hiv prevalence of 10-19% ,  only around 7% of companies have formal hiv / aids policies in place ,  according to the report .  the gap is even wider in china ,  ethiopia ,  india ,  nigeria and russia ,  the so-called "next wave" countries ,  which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new hiv / aids cases worldwide by 2010 .  the report adds "an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the hiv / aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting , " said david bloom ,  professor of economics and demography at the harvard school of public health .  the wef report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to hiv / aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them .  a key priority ,  in both high and low-prevalence settings ,  said the wef is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality . 
__label__tech net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e-mail .  lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out .  the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool ,  spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data .

"every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day , " he said ,  "about one mp3 file . " but ,  he said ,  if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day .  lycos did not want to use e-mail to fight back ,  said mr pollmann .  "that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing , " he said .  the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e-mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer .  typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e-mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day .  the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real-time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop .  to limit the chance of mistakes being made ,  lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods .  as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs ,  the burden of high-bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive ,  said mr pollmann .  sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests .  early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85% .  users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver .  while working ,  the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data .  the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on 1 december and before now has only been trialled in sweden .  despite the soft launch ,  mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20 , 000 times in the last four days .  "there ' s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day-by-day but to do something more , " he said "before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive . "
__label__business chinese online game operator shanda interactive entertainment has bought a 20% stake in sina ,  the country ' s biggest internet portal firm .  the move may be a precursor to a full takeover ,  with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in sina .  shanda said that it may boost its stake in sina ,  even buying it outright .  a merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games ,  news ,  entertainment and wireless messaging .  sina said that the purchase of a stake by shanda would have no impact on its business .  the board of directors said in a statement that it would "continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders ,  including shareholders ,  employees and customers" .  both companies are listed on the new york stock exchange ' s  ( nyse )  technology-dominated nasdaq index .  in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission ,  sina said its shares were purchased between 12 january and 10 february for about $230m .  rumours about a possible takeover boosted sina ' s shares by more than 10% on friday .  they added an extra 6 . 4% to $27 . 24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished .  and there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in new york on tuesday after monday ' s public holiday ,  analysts forecast .  "there could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid , " said wallace cheung ,  an analyst at dbs vickers .  "even though shanda has 20% of sina ,  they still have quite a long way to take full control . " however ,  mr cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a chinese internet portal firm ,  with its ability to filter and pass on news ,  may not be viewed very favourably by beijing . 
__label__tech fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online ,  research suggests .  a quarter of broadband users in britain regularly upload content and have personal sites ,  according to a report by uk think-tank demos .  it said that having an always-on ,  fast connection is changing the way people use the internet .  more than five million households in the uk have broadband and that number is growing fast .  the demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people ' s net habits .  it found that more than half of those with broadband logged on to the web before breakfast .  one in five even admitted to getting up in the middle of the night to browse the web .  more significantly ,  argues the report ,  broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online .  it found that one in five post something on the net everyday ,  ranging from comments or opinions on sites to uploading photographs .  "broadband is putting the  ' me '  in media as it shifts power from institutions and into the hands of the individual , " said john craig ,  co-author of the demos report .  "from self-diagnosis to online education ,  broadband creates social innovation that moves the debate beyond simple questions of access and speed . " the demos report ,  entitled broadband britain: the end of asymmetry ?  ,  was commissioned by net provider aol .  "broadband is moving the perception of the internet as a piece of technology to an integral part of home life in the uk , " said karen thomson ,  chief executive of aol uk ,  "with many people spending time on their computers as automatically as they might switch on the television or radio . " according to analysts nielsen /  / netratings ,  more than 50% of the 22 . 8 million uk net users regularly accessing the web from home each month are logging on at high speed they spend twice as long online than people on dial-up connections ,  viewing an average of 1 , 444 pages per month .  the popularity of fast net access is growing ,  partly fuelled by fierce competition over prices and services . 
__label__business the us dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on friday as concern grows about the size of the us budget deficit .  analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the us economy .  the bush administration ' s apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern .  however ,  trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand .  this has amplified reactions to news ,  analysts said ,  adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january .  the dollar was trading at $1 . 3652 versus the euro on friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1 . 3667 on thursday .  one dollar bought 102 . 55 yen .  disappointing business figures from chicago triggered the us currency ' s weakness on thursday .  the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61 . 2 ,  a bigger fall than expected .  "there are no dollar buyers now ,  especially after the chicago data yesterday , " said abn amro ' s paul mackel .  at the same time ,  german chancellor gerhard schroeder and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi voiced concerns about the strength of the euro .  mr berlusconi said the euro ' s strength was "absolutely worrying" for italian exports .  mr schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances .  investors will now look towards february ' s meeting of finance ministers from the g7 industrialised nations in london for clues as to whether central banks will combine forces to stem the dollar ' s decline . 
__label__business parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year .  the firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros  ( $19bn; £10bn )  and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders .  he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions .  parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time .  under italian law ,  administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency ,  if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble .  the firm also said it is preparing further law suits .  according to the reuters news agency ,  35 of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining 10 are international .  the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions .  among those already targeted are bank of america ,  ubs ,  credit suisse first boston ,  deutsche bank and citigroup .  it has also gone after auditors grant thornton .  they have all denied any wrongdoing .  parmalat was declared insolvent in december 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist .  in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company ,  among other things ,  had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet .  that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas ,  allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange . 
__label__tech the net ' s self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection .  scott richter ,  the man behind optinrealbig . com and billions of junk mail messages ,  said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11 .  optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles ,  most notably against microsoft ,  which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages .  the company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading .  listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus ,  optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws .  the lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries .  according to microsoft the messages were sent via net addresses owned by the kuwait ministries of communication and finance ,  several korean schools ,  the seoul municipal boramae hospital ,  and the virginia community college system .  mr richter settled the attorney general case in july 2004 but the legal fight with microsoft is continuing .  microsoft is seeking millions in dollars in damages from optinrealbig under anti-spam laws that impose penalties for every violation .  in a statement announcing the desire to seek bankruptcy protection the company said it: "could not continue to contend with legal maneuvers  ( sic )  by a number of companies across the country ,  including microsoft ,  and still run a viable business . " in its chapter 11 filing optinrealbig claimed it had assets of less than $10m  ( £5 . 29m )  but debts of more than $50m which included the $46m that microsoft is seeking via its lawsuit .  "the litigation has been a relentless distraction with which to contend , " said steven richter ,  legal counsel for optinrealbig .  "but ,  make no mistake ,  we do expect to prevail . " for its part optinrealbig describes itself as a premier internet marketing company and said the move to seek chapter 11 was necessary to let it keep trading while sorting out its legal battles .

__label__tech the fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species .  research by handset maker nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take .  according to the study ,  more than 45 million people in the uk ,  germany ,  us and south korea now only use a mobile .  it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower ,  but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile .  the nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes .  home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter ,  between mobiles and to friends .  in the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile .  however ,  when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared .  in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds .  in all the countries where interviews were carried out ,  older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile .  women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone ,  the research found .  the move to mobile was most pronounced in south korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile .  18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house .  many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the "cosiness" of making a call there .  nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap ,  reliable and providing good call quality .  the survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless .  some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years .  polling firm mori interviewed more than 6 , 000 people in the uk ,  us ,  germany and south korea for the survey . 
__label__tech legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down .  one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program .  a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january .  but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are "quality copies" .  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network .  the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised .  that file-sharing system relies on links called "trackers" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for .  shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network .  one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova . org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to .  now the man behind suprnova . org ,  who goes by the nickname sloncek ,  is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem .  in an interview with novastream web radio ,  sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems .  like bittorrent ,  exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want .  like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone .  there will be no centrally maintained list .  this ,  said sloncek ,  should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music .  the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users .  an early public version of the software should be available before february .  sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development .  there were no plans for a linux or mac version .  he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program .  despite suprnova administrator sloncek ' s involvement with exeem ,  the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis .  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files ,  sloncek told novastream .  dr johan pouwelse ,  a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks ,  said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems .  but ,  he said ,  it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared .  "exeem cannot prevent pollution , " he said .  "the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings , " he said .  studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes .  by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality .  "the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that ' s full of crap like kazaa , " he said .  "there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity , " he said .  mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading .  when big files were being shared moderation systems were key ,  said mr pouwelse .  he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic .  "it ' s hard to compete with free , " he said .  no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development . 
__label__tech the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time ,  by us magazine mobile pc .  the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first "lightweight" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs .  the magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets ,  which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two .  gadgets needed moving parts and / or electronics to warrant inclusion .  the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a "self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own ,  not a subset of another device" .  "in general we included only items that were potentially mobile , " said the magazine .  "in the end ,  we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget , " it concluded .  the oldest "gadget" in the top 100 is the abacus ,  which the magazine dates at 190 a . d .  ,  and put in 60th place .  other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731  ( 59th position )  ,  the marine chronometer from 1761  ( 42nd position )  and the kodak brownie camera from 1900  ( 28th position )  .  the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 ,  which also includes the first flash mp3 player  ( diamound multimedia )  ,  as well as the first "successful" digital camera  ( casio qv-10 )  and mobile phone  ( motorola startac )  .  the most popular gadget of the moment ,  the apple ipod ,  is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13 .  sony ' s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp-101 cd player from 1983 .  "who can forget the crystalline ,  hiss-free blast of madonna ' s like a virgin emenating from their first cd player ? " asked the magazine .  karl elsener ' s knife ,  the swiss army knife from 1891 ,  is at number 20 in the list .  gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone  ( 23rd )  ,  the nintendo gameboy  ( 25th )  ,  and the pulsar quartz digital watch  ( 36th )  .  the list also contains plenty of oddities: the pez sweet dispenser  ( 98th )  ,  1980s toy tamagotchi  ( 86th )  and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler  ( 84th )  .  why worry about mobile phones .  soon they will be subsumed into the pda ' s  /  laptops etc .  what about the marine chronometer ?  completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries .  for it ' s time ,  a technological marvel !  sony net minidisc !  it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market .  i always used my netmd ,  and could not go anywhere without it .  a laptop computer is not a gadget !  it ' s a working tool !  the sinclair executive was the world ' s first pocket calculator .  i think this should be there as well .  how about the clockwork radio ?  or gps ?  or a pocket calculator ?  all these things are useful to real people ,  not just pc magazine editors .  are the people who created this list insane  ?  surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone ?  it has revolutionalised communication ,  which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop .  from outside the modern age ,  the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget ,  without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly .  has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker ?  ?  an interesting list .  of the electronic gadgets ,  thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the tandy 100 .  the size of a4 paper and light ,  three weeks on a set of batteries ,  an excellent keyboard ,  a modem .  a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible .  what ' s an apple powerbook 100  ?  it ' s out of date - not much of a "gadget" .  surely it has to be something simple  /  timeless - the tin opener ,  swiss army knife ,  safety razor blade ,  wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves  ?  it has to be the mobile phone .  no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time .  the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever .  also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule .  the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980 .  a true gadget ,  it could be carried around and shown off .  all top 10 are electronic toys ,  so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else .  i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20 .  sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time .  the first home machine with a true multi-takings os .  shame the marketing was so bad !  !  !  apple .  .  a triumph of fashion over .  .  .  well everything else .  utter rubbish .  yes ,  the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets .  but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer  ' gadgets '  and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective .  the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see .  the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed .  no competition .  i ' d also put apple ' s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing ,  and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason .  i only wish that vulcan inc ' s flipstart wasn ' t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top .  how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone  ( mobile or otherwise )  ?  what about radios and tvs ?  the swiss army knife .  by far the most useful gadget .  i got mine 12 years ago .  still wearing and using it a lot !  it stood the test of time .  psion organiser series 3 ,  should be up there .  had a usable qwerty keyboard ,  removable storage ,  good set of apps and programmable .  case design was good  ( batteries in the hinge - a first ,  i think )  .  great product innovation .  the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of .  .  . err .  .  .  mobile pc ?  !  why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site ?  it ' s obviously the mobile phone or remote control ,  and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that .  the motorola startac should be number one .  why ?  there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices .  the psion series 3c !  the first most practical way to carry all your info around .  .  .  i too would back the sinclair spectrum - without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now .  i ' d have put the mobile phone high up the list .  probably a nokia model .  sinclair spectrum - 16k .  it plugged into the tv .  games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that ' s what i do for a living now .  i wish more modern notebooks -- even apple ' s newest offerings -- were more like the pb100 .  particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball ,  which has given way to the largely useless "trackpad" which every notebook on the market today uses .  they ' re invariably inaccurate ,  uncomfortable ,  and cumbersome to use .  congratulations to apple ,  a deserved win !

__label__business the european central bank has left its key interest rate unchanged at 2% for the 19th month in succession .  borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro ,  analysts said .  despite signs of pick-up ,  labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish ,  while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies .  high oil prices ,  meanwhile ,  have put upward pressure on the inflation rate .  surveys of economists have shown that the majority expect borrowing costs to stay at 2% in coming months ,  with an increase of a quarter of a percentage point predicted some time in the second half of the year .  if anything ,  there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut ,  especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar .  "the euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery , " said economist dirk schumacher .  the ecb "may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again ,  they will . " data coming out of germany on thursday underlined the problems facing european policy makers .  while germany ' s economy expanded by 1 . 7% in 2004 ,  growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year .  the strength of the euro is threatening to dampen that foreign demand in 2005 ,  and domestic consumption currently is not strong enough to take up the slack .  inflation in the eurozone ,  however ,  is estimated at about 2 . 3% in december ,  above ecb guidelines of 2% .  ecb president jean-claude trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region ,  and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005 .  the ecb has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1 . 9% in 2005 . 
__label__politics a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males .  the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown .  it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics .  but the government refused to back lord dubs '  succession to the crown bill ,  saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues .  the lord chancellor ,  lord falconer ,  agreed the 1701 act of settlement ,  which governs the succession ,  was discriminatory but added that "for all practical purposes its effects are limited" .  the changes proposed by lord dubs were a "complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues" ,  he said .  lord falconer said there were 22 members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales - all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act .  "it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly .  while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination .  .  .  this isn ' t the proper form , " he added .  he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs '  private member ' s bill was passed by peers ,  he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons .  lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords ,  but urged the government to think again at a later stage .  "we cannot forever say we don ' t want to change things because it is too difficult , " he told peers .  during the debate ,  the labour peer and former minister said: "the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country .  "what we don ' t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times .  "we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics . " but opponents of the bill ,  including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester ,  the rt rev michael scott-joynt ,  said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith .  such a "secular" state would be markedly "less tolerant" ,  rt rev scott-joynt argued . 
__label__tech the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing .  a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below .  if you think of snake when some mentions "mobile games" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise .  this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time .  even before nokia ' s n-gage game phone launched in late 2003 ,  many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset .  and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market .  that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home ,  game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can .  life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed .  now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste .  there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders ,  lunar lander and bejewelled .  there are also versions of titles ,  such as colin mcrae rally ,  that you typically find on pcs and consoles .  there are shoot-em-ups ,  adventure games ,  strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets .  rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in .  increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film ,  understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads .  the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5 .  what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push .  by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset .  far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals .  the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too .  almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics .  the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too .  now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option .  the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too .  some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile .  many titles ,  particularly racing games ,  let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others .  usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a "ghost" or "shadow" to see if you can beat them .  a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or ,  if you are sitting close to them ,  via bluetooth short-range radio technology .  with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening .  but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing .   too fast too furious  ( digital bridges )   as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i ' m rubbish at them .  no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers .  the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit .  winning gives you cash for upgrades .  graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background .  the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track .  the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play .   fatal force  ( macrospace )   a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth .  graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring .  both background music and sounds effects work well .  the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders .  weapons include flamethrowers ,  rocket launchers ,  grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while .  with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens .  the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range .  online the game has quite a following with clans ,  player rankings and even new downloadable maps . 
__label__business us retail sales ended the year on a high note with solid gains in december ,  boosted by strong car sales .  seasonally adjusted sales rose 1 . 2% in the month ,  compared to 0 . 1% a month earlier ,  boosted by a surge in shopping just before and after christmas .  sales climbed 8% for the year ,  the best performance since an 8 . 5% rise in 1999 ,  the commerce department added .  the gains were led by a 4 . 3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms .  dealers were forced to cut prices in december to maintain sales growth in a tough quarter when the usual end-of-year holiday sales boom was slow to get started .  the increase in sales during december pushed total spending for the month to $349 . 4bn  ( £265 . 9bn )  .  sales for the year also broke through the $4 trillion mark for the first time - with annual sales coming in at $4 . 06 trillion however ,  if automotives are excluded from december ' s data ,  retail sales rose just 0 . 3% on the month .  home furnishings and furniture stores also performed well ,  rising 2 . 2% .  but as well as hitting the shops ,  more us consumers were going online or using mail order for their purchases - with non-store retailers seeing sales rise by 1 . 9% .  however ,  analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the federal reserve bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises .  "consumers for now remain willing to spend freely ,  sustaining the us expansion .  given that attitude ,  the fed remains likely to continue boosting the fed funds rate at upcoming meetings , " ubs economist maury harris told reuters .  retail sales are seen as a major part of consumer spending - which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the us .  consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during 2001 and 2002 as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the world trade centre attacks .  during that time ,  sales grew a lacklustre 2 . 9% in 2001 and 2 . 5% a year later .  looking ahead ,  analysts now expect improvement in jobs growth to feed through to the high street with consumer spending remaining strong .  the belief comes despite the latest labor department report showing a surprise rise in unemployment .  the number of americans filing initial jobless claims jumped to 367 , 000 ,  the highest rate since september .  however ,  long-term claims slipped to their lowest level since 2001 . 
__label__entertainment the new big-screen version of the magic roundabout ,  released in the uk on friday ,  is the latest attempt to turn children ' s television into box-office gold .  recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit ' s five children and it ,  previously filmed by the bbc in 1991 .  he-man and transformers ,  which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s ,  will soon receive their own costly makeovers .  with screen versions of the a-team ,  the dukes of hazzard and even blake ' s seven on the cards ,  nostalgia is clearly big business .  but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals .  the new version of the magic roundabout ,  which will be released as sprung !  in the us ,  replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished ,  computer-generated animation .  in a similar fashion ,  the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original ' s puppets and models .  the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences .  pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout ,  while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song .  but while some reviewers have been won over ,  there has nonetheless been a significant backlash .  "this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit , " writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site .  and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors '  outrage that gerry anderson ' s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins .  dan jolin ,  reviews editor of empire magazine ,  says classic children ' s tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention .  "i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today .  "but i think it ' s backfiring .  what ' s next - the clangers on some distant planet ,  with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them ? " despite thunderbirds '  disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m  ( £22m )  but only recouped $21m  ( £11m )  - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating .  it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment .  after the success of garfield: the movie ,  britain ' s shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle .  with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series ,  there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat ,  professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ .  furry recyclers have already had one big-screen outing - 1977 ' s wombling free .  but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback .  advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc ' s supernatural comedy  .  and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv ' s most popular cartoon buccaneer ,   .  it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed .  the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february .  how about bringing catweazle to the big screen ?  he could give gandalf a run for his money !  thundercats !  !  i loved it .  should be fun to see on the big screen ,  if some effort is put in !  it will bring my youth back !  get your hands off the clangers !  is nothing sacred ?  make a movie version of the banana splits !  what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops ?  or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy .  you forgot to mention the grearest of them all ,  danger mouse !  but then again ,  it couldn ' t be better than the original series ,  could it ?  it ' s always nice to see these old toons re-released ,  but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie  ( and the song !  )  i think i ' ve been completely put off .  just leave these classics alone as good memories .  i think remakes are a good idea .  as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe .  i believe this is the whole reason "retro" has become so popular .  as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series .  personally i ' d like to see cartoons such as transformers ,  thundercats and m . a . s . k .  get full hollywood remakes .  leave them alone ,  why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place ?  the thunderbirds film was apalling ,  not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson .  love to see transformers with real actors and cgi .  and make it at least a 15 rating .  part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect .  they were moody ,  sarcastic ,  and rather human .  just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved .  dougal never smiled like that !  films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing ,  and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place .  i have fond memories of bod  ( not least of which because i look like him )  and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film .  it ' s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story .  bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two .  it ' s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a  ' new '  audience ,  but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this ,  and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it .  it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice ,  but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood ,  they are never going to live up to expectation .  it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made ,  are film-makers running out of original ideas ?  all i can say is bring back danger mouse ,  probably the greatest kids '  show ever .  i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child .  there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back .  again ,  like so many of these nostalgia programmes ,  the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original ' s cut out paper technique for inventiveness ,  and was woefully inadequate .  we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration ,  clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new .  seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it ' s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them ,  rather than being daring and trying something new .  it got to be mr . benn .  the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop ,  steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing !  if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great .  and who to play the lead role ?  well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin .  if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character .  muffin the mule perhaps  ?  after all ,  grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know !  why can ' t the british film industry try making gerry anderson ' s ufo or captain scarlet ,  or saphire and steel ,  or the tomorrow people .  in today ' s media ,  it seems the past is the future .  tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes ,  dj ' s are sampling or re-working 70 ' s and 80 ' s music .  even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings .  personally ,  i think it shows that no one has any originality any more !  why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone .  mary ,  mungo and midge .  but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs .  plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block ?  yeah but no but i wasn ' t even there !  i ' d like to see mr .  benn ,  with brad pitt in the title role .  sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner .  it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today ' s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia .  there are plany of modern children ' s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes ,  why not use them instead of rehashing the past ?  mr .  benn with rowan atkinson as the lead .  would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made ,  but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn ' t come up to scratch .  the only one that isn ' t to be remade as yet is thundercats ,  which i ' d like to see .  i ' m an expat living in norway ,  and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children ' s programs for my 2 daughters .  my dearest wish ,  however ,  is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen !  !  very scandinavian .  .  .  rainbow !  i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone ,  and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office ,  especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie ,  popular among children because it ' s original ,  witty ,  and modern .  the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago .  how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies ,  rentaghost ,  terrahawks ,  bod .  .  .  .  . oh the list could go on and on !  !  !  if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ' ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy ,  eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch .  repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price !  i don ' t care !  till then i ' ll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert .  i ' d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same .  and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden ,  superb children ' s programme .  could morph hold his own in a big screen movie ?  ?  ?  or even jamie and the magic torch .  .  .  . hmmmmm ,  i could go on and on .  danger mouse ?  at 34 i ' m showing my age .  :- )  noggin the nog was one of the best children ' s programs .  the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate ' s wonderful voices .  so in general leave well alone .  the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story .  just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs .  .  .  the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy ,  yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermouse bob the builder ,  postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire ,  post and bricks .  in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns ,  krusty and gobo .  will they triumph or will they fail miserably ?  find out this fall .  one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90 .  it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe ' s car .  of course ,  gerry anderson ' s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen ,  big-budget action .  it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children ' t movie that really let it down .  after all ,  the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves .  it ' s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods ,  isn ' t it ?  i ' d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that  ' done in a shed '  clunkiness and you couldn ' t recreate the magic .  perhaps if the remakes were done in a  ' look around you '  mock-authentic style i might be interested  .  .  .  chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega !  this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people ' s ideas ,  because it guarantees to bring in the $$$ .  the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material ,  will young etc .  the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term .  the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant  ( e . g .  starsky & hutch )  hence ,  the market is saturated with this mindless drivel ,  but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it !  i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies .  i ' m only 27 and don ' t remember the series from when it was on tv ,  but have the set on dvd and it ' s a classic .  the fact it ' s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today ' s stuff it looks amateurish .  thats the appeal though ,  it ' s so innocent  ( like chorlton himself )  and it would be a real shame if they did remake it . 
__label__tech apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players .  its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb .  the company ,  which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market ,  also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped .  a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family .  the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of £40 .  the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design .  during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold ,  10 million of which were apple ipods .  but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store ,  which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market .  mike mcguire ,  a research director at analyst gartner ,  told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in "sealing off the market from competition" so far .  "they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design ,  function and the software are very impressive , " he said .  he added that the threat from others was always present ,  however .  "creative ,  other microsoft-partnered devices ,  real ,  sony and so on ,  are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising , " he said .  creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year ,  he said .  its second-generation models ,  like the creative zen micro photo ,  is due out in the summer .  it will have 5gb of memory on board .  digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans ,  according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project .  one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort .  sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004 ,  according to the record industry ,  with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months .  the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth .  analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players .  people are also starting to use them in novel ways .  some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows ,  called podcasts .  but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets .  according to mr mcguire ,  research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music ,  which they can do with high-capacity storage devices ,  like ipods and creative zens .  mobiles do not yet have this capacity though ,  and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music .  mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones . 
__label__entertainment lord of the rings director peter jackson has said that it will be up to four years before he starts work on a film version of the hobbit .  the oscar winner said on a visit to sydney there was a "desire" to make it ,  but not before lengthy negotiations .  "i think it ' s gonna be a lot of lawyers sitting in a room trying to thrash out a deal before it will ever happen , " said the new zealander .  the rights to jrr tolkien ' s book are split between two major film studios .  jackson ,  who is currently filming a remake of hollywood classic king kong ,  said he thought that the sale of mgm studios to the sony corporation would cast further uncertainty on the project .  the 43-year-old was in the australian city to visit a lord of the rings exhibition ,  which has attracted 140 , 000 visitors since it opened in december .  the film-maker recently sued film company new line cinema for undisclosed damages over alleged withheld profits and lost revenue from the first part of the middle earth trilogy .  the fellowship of the ring from 2001 went on to make worldwide profits of $291 million  ( £152 million )  .  jackson is thought to have secured the most lucrative film directing deal in history to remake king kong ,  which is currently in production in wellington .  the picture ,  which stars naomi watts and oscar winner adrien brody ,  is due to be released in december .  jackson has also committed to making a film version of lovely bones ,  based on the best-selling book by alice sebold .

__label__sport it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to london ' s 2012 olympic bid .  but i still managed to do all my marathon training .  all the sporting people on the capital ' s bid team think i ' m mad to be taking part in the london marathon .  the bid chairman ,  lord coe ,  admitted he would never dream of running a marathon ,  even though he was an olympic middle-distance runner .  kelly holmes ,  former hurdler alan pascoe and former sprinter frankie fredericks - who is now an ioc member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far .  you ' d have thought all these athletes ,  who have been running for most of their lives ,  wouldn ' t think it would be that bad .  but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson ,  who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times .  even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee ' s  ( ioc )  evaluation commission ,  i actually found my running schedule easier to follow .  when i ' m at home ,  i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london ,  i was in a pressurised situation ,  but i found it easy to relax by running .  on wednesday ,  the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening ,  so i just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run .  we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london ,  that was pretty shattering ,  but when we got back to the hotel ,  i got back on the treadmill .  on friday evening i went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was a nice occasion .  i never feel guilty about eating ,  especially when i ' m exercising .  and because it was a rest day i didn ' t have to feel bad about missing my training either .  anyway ,  i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations ,  before heading home for my daughter ' s birthday .  when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill ,  which isn ' t the same as exercising outdoors .  one of the ioc ' s technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day .  we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly .  i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning .  but when you ' re gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement .  it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday .  after the week i ' d had i was a bit concerned i wouldn ' t be able to complete it .  but i coped with it very well and ,  even though it was bitterly cold ,  i put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then .  - this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami . steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport website . he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children ' s hospices ,  the children with leukaemia charity ,  and the trust ' s own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment . 
__label__sport spain ' s football federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach luis aragones over racist comments about thierry henry .  if found guilty aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about £22 , 000 .  the federation had initially declined to take action against aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in october .  but its president angel maria villar changed his mind after a request by spain ' s anti-violence commission .  aragones insisted the comments ,  made to henry ' s arsenal club-mate jose antonio reyes ,  were meant to motivate the player ,  and were not intended to be offensive .  "i never intended to offend anyone ,  and for that reason i have a very easy conscience , " he said at the time .  "i ' m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results .  "as part of that job ,  i use colloquial language ,  with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world .  " england ' s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against spain in madrid last month .  but the storm increased following racist chanting by spanish fans at england ' s black players during the game ,  which spain won 1-0 .  spain ' s minister of sport jaime lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the federation ' s decision .  "everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations ,  and make sure they do not give a negative image , " he said .  "we are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism .

"the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master , " he says .  but currently ,  putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand .  "as much as you compress the picture data rate wise ,  you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master , " he explains .  "i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high-def world and i find it very exciting . " high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to .  it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months '  time .  mr dean is confident though: "i think if they see real hd [high-definition] ,  not some heavily compressed version of it ,  there is such a remarkable difference .  "i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen . " high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too .  on the whole ,  producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed .  equally ,  it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd .  "when we master movies right now ,  our data rates are running at about 1 . 2 gigabits per second , " says mr dean .  "our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second .  "that ' s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied - about 98% .  so if you have anything that allows more space ,  you don ' t have to compress so hard . " studios could fit a lot more marketing material ,  games ,  and features ,  onto high-capacity dvds .  currently ,  an entire dvd project can take up to three months ,  says mr dean .  although the step of down-converting will be bypassed ,  this will realistically only save a day ' s work ,  says mr dean .  one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems .  on the fairly complex star wars disks ,  making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone .  if studios want to cash in on the extra space ,  it could mean extra human hours ,  for which someone has to pay .  "if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks ,  it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required . " and if studios do focus on delivering more "added value content" ,  thinks mr dean ,  ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it .  those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd .  but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price ,  studios will listen ,  thinks mr dean .  high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike .  more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous .  "when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i ,  everybody was very sun-tanned ,  but that was make-up .  "in the hd version of episode i ,  all these make-up lines showed up , " explains mr dean .  the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too .  "there are scans of a corridor [on the death star] and fairly plainly in one of those shots ,  there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways .  "you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn ' t see it . " what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur .  with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas ,  this line blurs even further .  it could also mean that how we get films ,  and in what format ,  will widen .  "in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip [internet protocol - broadband] ,  giving a dvd-like experience from the set-top box to the hard drive , " says mr dean .  but that is some time off for most ,  and for now ,  people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves .

__label__sport kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton ' s 10-game unbeaten run .  lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank ,  then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross .  wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos ,  who ended a fluid passing move with a well-struck volley .  but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances ,  pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer ' s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner .  neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game ,  with plenty of tackles flying in ,  but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by .  bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first-half - keeping out shearer ' s low shot and dyer ' s close-range header - but that was the only goalmouth action of note .  and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes .  bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half-way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right .  he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr ' s cross with a downward header into the far corner .  bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well .  they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos .  jay-jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed ,  the greek striker found the bottom corner with a first-time strike .  the magpies were opened up again before half-time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post .  but the home side survived ,  and they should have re-taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half .  fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through .  but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby ,  and from the resultant free-kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide .  bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies .  their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute .  alan shearer ' s snap-shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards .  - bolton boss sam allardyce "i am bitterly disappointed with the result ,  but i am probably more disappointed with the second-half performance .  "in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure ,  and our goal matched theirs in quality .  "i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games ,  but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half .  "we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us ,  and in the end we cracked . "   - newcastle boss graeme souness "we deserved the win .  we had a really good second half .  "bolton are a difficult side to play .  you have to match them physically first but we did that ,  and then we played some football .

__label__tech a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps .  victor wong ,  a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state ,  had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research .  to study "space weather" mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models .  a number of solutions were tried ,  including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille .  mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music ,  and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work .  "the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself , " mr wong told the bbc news website .  "for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images . " he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot .  in order to have an exact reference to the screen ,  a pen and tablet device is used .  the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end .  mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally .  "if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it ,  it wouldn ' t work that well . " mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a "colour memory" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision .  "as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour ' s getting redder and redder ,  and in my mind ' s eye a patch of red appears . " the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially ,  and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable .  but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images .

__label__business india is to boost spending on primary schools and health in a budget flagged as a boost for the ordinary citizen .  india ' s defence budget has also been raised 7 . 8% to 830bn rupees  ( $19bn )  .  the priority for finance minister palaniappan chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government ' s communist allies onside .  but his options are limited by a new law which makes him cut the budget deficit ,  which he said would be 4 . 5% of gdp in the year to march 2005 .  the country ' s overall deficit is thought to be more than 10% ,  if the spending of india ' s 35 states and territories is included .  under the fiscal responsibility law ,  mr chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0 . 3 percentage points each year ,  a target he says he has now met for the current year .  but the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4 . 3% ,  mr chidambaram said - falling short of the new law ' s requirement .  "i was left with no option but to press the pause button vis a vis the act , " he said .  the following year ,  though ,  would have to be back on track ,  he warned .  "i may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means , " he said .  the coming year ' s reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in india ' s burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system ,  although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget .  presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament ,  mr chidambaram said the indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in .  he said india ' s economy grew 6 . 9% in 2004 .  in his budget mr chidambaram has: - increased spending on primary education to 71 . 56bn rupees  ( $1 . 6bn )    - increased spending on health to 102 . 8bn rupees  ( $2 . 35bn )    - announced that 80bn rupees  ( $1 . 8bn )  will be spent on building rural infrastructure   - pledged 102 . 16bn rupees  ( $2 . 3bn )  for tsunami victims   - increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%   - announced a package for the sugar industry in addition ,  up to 100bn rupees  ( $2 . 3bn )  to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country ' s foreign exchange reserves ,  keeping budgeted spending under control .  "given the resilience of the indian economy .  .  .  it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty , " mr chidambaram said .  "the whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty . " the new indian government ,  led by the congress party ,  was voted into power last may after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with a "human face" .  the finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming india ' s tax system while expanding the tax base .  as part of his reforms he has announced: - duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials   - expanded service tax net   - raised the income-tax threshold to 100 , 000 rupees  ( $2 , 300 )    - reduced income tax for those earning less than 250 , 000 rupees  ( $5 , 700 )  to 20%   - reduced corporate tax rates to 30% an annual economic survey released on friday said india needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment ,  reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth .  but mr chidambaram is under pressure from the communist parties to focus on increasing social spending .  the communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will .  in recent months ,  they have expressed their displeasure at the government ' s economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation .  in his last budget ,  mr chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers . 
__label__politics distinguished lawyer lord scarman ,  who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 brixton riots ,  has died aged 93 .  the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career ,  serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years .  he also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland .  paying tribute ,  the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the "great advocates of our generation" .  "his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial .  "his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none .  "a great judge ,  a great lawyer and a great man . " lord scarman ' s nephew george ritchie said the peer ,  who passed away peacefully on wednesday ,  would be "sadly missed" .  the lord chief justice ,  lord woolf ,  who is the most senior judge in england and wales ,  said it was lord scarman ' s "pioneering work" which paved the way for the human rights act 1998 .  "he was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature ,  and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society , " he said .  "he was ,  personally ,  totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him . " dame elizabeth butler-sloss ,  the president of the family justice division ,  said lord scarman was a "good and humane judge" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century .  lord scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery .  during the following three days of disturbances that spread to the midlands ,  merseyside ,  bristol and leeds ,  nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight .  the inquiry famously settled on the so-called "rotten apples" theory ,  which argued that only a few police officers were racist ,  saying most were not .  it spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the police complaints authority .  trevor phillips ,  chair of the commission for racial equality ,  praised lord scarman ' s "ability to listen" .  he said: "when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying .  "a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment .  "his great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds ,  many of whose language he could barely understand ,  genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings .  "he never lost the special combination of wisdom ,  humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the brixton riots . "
__label__tech after bubbling under for some time ,  online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004 .  the us presidential election provided a showcase for many ,  aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads .  experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society .  the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the iowa game ,  commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean .  more than 20 followed suit ,  including frontrunner ,  elections ,  president forever and the political machine ,  which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign ,  including having to cope with the media .  others helped raise the stakes during the bush / kerry contest by highlighting a candidate ' s virtues or his vices .  the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games ,  a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers .  "when i started researching political games at the university ,  about five years ago ,  i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen , " said gonzalo frasca ,  computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen .  "i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved , " added the uruguayan-born researcher ,  who has so far created games for two political campaigns .  many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming . com .  the aim is to comment on international news events via games .  the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way .  "video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new ,  but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation , " mr frasca told the bbc news website .  this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay ,  cambiemos ,  an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country ' s problems could be solved by working together .  "it ' s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games . " ultimately ,  dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes ,  fears and beliefs .  "children learn a lot about the world through play .  there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up . " but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns .  this is hardly surprising ,  compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web .  only a few years ago ,  most politicians did not have a webpage ,  while now it is almost a must-have .  dr frasca said: "political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games .  they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them . " "it will not replace other forms of political propaganda ,  but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns . "
__label__tech a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer-based inventions .  the draft law was not adopted by eu ministers as planned at a brussels meeting on monday during which it was supposed to have been discussed .  the fresh delay came after polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months .  critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation .  "there was at one point the intention to put the item on today ' s agenda .  but in the end we could not put it on , " an eu spokesman told the reuters agency .  he added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law .  in december ,  poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software .  its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting .  poland is a large eu member ,  so its backing for the legislation is vital .  the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us ,  but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters .  in the us ,  the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted .  this means that the us-based amazon . com holds a patent for its "one-click shopping" service .  critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies .  but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing .

"although the eu is a customs union ,  there is no single eu customs administration , " a statement issued on behalf of robert zoellick ,  us trade representative ,  said .  lack of uniformity ,  coupled with lack of procedures for prompt eu-wide review can hinder us exports ,  especially for small to mid-sized businesses" ,  an eu spokesman in washington dismissed the us complaint .

__label__politics ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers ,  amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments .  councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land .  more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks ,  said housing minister yvette cooper .  in november ,  mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 , 500 travellers have no place to stop .  ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places .  that scheme has paid out £25m in four years ,  with £8m available for 2005 .  "there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites , " said ms cooper .  "firstly ,  local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites .  and secondly ,  they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites .  "the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites ,  causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers .  "that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites ,  as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short-term because of risk to local amenity and the environment . " under the new regulations ,  expected to be in force in the spring ,  officials will be able to serve "temporary stop notices" aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban .  many mps with rural constituencies ,  particularly in eastern england ,  have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers ,  saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments .  andrew ryder ,  of the traveller law reform coalition ,  said: "we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers ,  so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored .  "new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers ,  as they often do .  "living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals ,  legal action and eviction is no one ' s idea of fun . " in their november report ,  mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister ,  responsible for housing ,  said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop .  numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities ,  said the mps .  in turn ,  the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents .  two of the most controversial traveller sites - cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire - remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle .

"compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults ,  mtv ' s programming contains substantially more sex ,  foul language and violence - and mtv ' s shows are aimed at children as young as 12 .  "there ' s no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers ,  and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children .

__label__politics smoke-free areas will save lives and improve scotland ' s health ,  first minister jack mcconnell has insisted .  he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a "comprehensive ban" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006 .  mr mcconnell said the country ' s health rates were "lamentable" not least because of smoking .  he said fines of up to £2 , 500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance .  earlier ,  the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places .  in a statement to parliament ,  mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force .  the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost ,  he told msps .  he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby "tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past" .  "there are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health , " he declared .  "health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise ,  drugs abuse ,  excessive drinking and over-eating .  "they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe ,  and too many smoke .  "it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking . " the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service  ( miscellaneous provisions )  bill ,  which will be considered by parliament before christmas .  main points of the plan:  - a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland   - the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers   - licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2 , 500   - licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence   - a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined   - individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1 , 000 .     mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less .  he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in new york and 16% in ireland .  mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and ,  in ireland ,  only a one point three per cent volume sales fall ,  where they were declining before the ban .  the afternoon announcement ,  following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning ,  won broad support from opposition parties .  the scottish national party ' s holyrood leader ,  nicola sturgeon ,  welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date .  she said: "the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places .  "there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit .  "but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded . " the scottish conservative party leader ,  david mcletchie ,  questioned what would be exempted from the ban .  he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke .  mr mcletchie asked: "would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister ' s brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals ? " the scottish green party ' s health spokeswoman ,  eleanor scott ,  said she was pleased scotland would be following the "success stories of new york and ireland" .  she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke .

" i think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues .  also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels .  rather than expecting the government - i . e .  the taxpayer - to fork out ,  why don ' t some of the megastars put something back in ?  some of britain ' s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums ,  concerts etc .  there are far more important demands on government funds .  if they can fund football ,  why not fund music ?  areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants ,  so why not music ?  we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music .  the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash .  the government has enough problems funding schools and health services .  if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that .  as a scot living in england ,  i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success ,  so i can see no problem with it !  franz ferdinand ,  travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world ,  so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods !  i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state ?  the answer is most definitely no .  those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn ' t be looking for government subsidies .  i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship .  yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses .  there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around ,  twiddling their thumbs on the "new deal" .  getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use .  as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move .  i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though ,  as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about .  only if the proposals make financial sense .  franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they ' d had a government grant to get started they ' d have more than paid it back by now ,  so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out .  however ,  the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they ' re a musician .  the government shouldn ' t "fund" music - it should "invest" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment .  i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise .  the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people .  however ,  i do feel this should be the extent of their role ,  to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there .  i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies !  they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately ,  the directors are in the business for !  if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn ' t have to fork out a great deal .  yeah ,  why not ?  music should be government funded ,  particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands / artists and stuff .  pop music pretty much rules the earth ,  so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer .  there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy .  perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is ,  the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers .  call it a tax on music "pollution" ,  if you like .  though i really like franz ferdinand ,  i have to disagree with mr kapranos .  once government gets their hand into the private sector ,  it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues .  many years ago ,  this was the case with the us nea ,  when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting .  the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations ,  like save the music in the us . 
__label__business us tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court ' s decision to reject the government ' s $280bn  ( £155bn )  claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers .  tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision .  the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws .  anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on ,  but the justice department has not said if it will appeal .  among the accused were altria group ,  rj reynolds tobacco ,  lorillard tobacco ,  liggett group and brown and williamson .  they were delighted by the decision ,  which sent reynolds shares up 4 . 5% and altria shares up 5 . 11% .  charles a blixt ,  executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco ,  said the ruling "dramatically transforms" the government ' s lawsuit .  altria group said ,  in a statement ,  the government now "must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past ,  but that they are likely to do so in the future . " the government had claimed tobacco firms  - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction   - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns   - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary .     prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to "disgorge" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products .  they brought the case under racketeering laws ,  which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes .  but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public .  they also said they had already met many of the government ' s demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998 .  the three-judge panel in the district of columbia ' s court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws .  judge david sentelle ,  in his ruling ,  said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward .  "we hold that the language of  ( the law )  and the comprehensive remedial scheme of  ( the law )  preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case , " he wrote .  the justice department refused to say if it would appeal .  "all we ' re saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it , " a spokeswoman said on friday .  but william corr of the campaign for tobacco-free kids urged the government to continue pressing its case .  "today ' s ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook , " he said . 
__label__tech search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites .  the autolink feature comes with google ' s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon . com if it finds a book ' s isbn number on the site .  it also links to google ' s map service ,  if there is an address ,  or to car firm carfax ,  if there is a licence plate .  google said the feature ,  available only in the us ,  "adds useful links" .  but some users are concerned that google ' s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon .  autolink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission .  if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book ' s unique isbn number would link directly to amazon ' s website .  it could mean online libraries that list isbn book numbers find they are directing users to amazon . com whether they like it or not .  websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services .  dan gillmor ,  founder of grassroots media ,  which supports citizen-based media ,  said the tool was a "bad idea ,  and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth" .  in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta ,  ie trial ,  stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users .  it said: "the user can choose never to click on the autolink button ,  and web pages she views will never be modified .  "in addition ,  the user can choose to disable the autolink feature entirely at any time . " the new tool has been compared to the smart tags feature from microsoft by some users .  it was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised .  smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company .  google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service .  some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any "click through" to a commercial site .  cory doctorow ,  european outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group electronic fronter foundation ,  said that google should not be penalised for its market dominance .  "of course google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses .  "but as an end user i would want to know -  ' can i choose to use this service ?  ,   ' how much is google being paid ?  '  ,   ' can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google ?  '  . " mr doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using autolink or "tricked into using the service" . 
__label__politics "he ' s not finished yet , " whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall .  and indeed he wasn ' t .  michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech ,  at his party ' s spring conference in brighton ,  to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain ' s description of him as an "attack mongrel" ,  claiming such personal abuse meant labour was "rattled" by the tory challenge .  and here he was again ,  moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause ,  to make a personal ,  ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory .  "one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine ,   ' i was there .  i did my bit .  i played my part .  i helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better '  . " the speech ,  which was peppered with references to mr howard ' s humble beginnings as the "child of immigrants" ,  had been introduced by his son nick ,  a trainee vicar ,  who praised his father ' s honesty .  "i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me , " he said .  mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra ,  daughter larissa and stepson sholto .  the audience ' s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards .  but mr howard ' s overall message - that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago .  mr howard claimed ,  with some justification ,  that the tories '  campaign has got off to a "great start" .  they have had labour on the back foot over immigration ,  with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card ,  and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education .  the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son ' s special needs education may not have been to everyone ' s taste ,  but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react .  senior tories believe they are ,  at long last ,  starting to tap into the public mood ,  cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter .  their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline ,  cleaner hospitals  ( "i mean ,  how hard is it to keep a hospital clean ? " )  and immigration  ( "it ' s not racist to impose limits on immigration" )  - under the headline "are you thinking what we are thinking ? " this ,  they say ,  contrasts with labour ' s negative campaigning ,  such as its now infamous "flying pigs" poster .  oliver letwin ,  one of the men lampooned in the labour poster ,  affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour ' s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail .  the peter hain "mongrel" attack ,  he says ,  is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product ,  he claims ,  of the tories setting the agenda .  "i have to say i don ' t understand what they are doing .  the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock ,  it doesn ' t seem to know what to do . " a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists '  morale - likely to be a crucial factor at an election which ,  most analysts seem to agree ,  will hinge on which party can get their core support out .  "it has been a fantastic few weeks , " said 20-year-old politics student nick vaughan .  "our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win .  i wouldn ' t be here if i didn ' t think we could . " some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970 ,  when ted heath ,  behind in the polls and written off by the pundits ,  snatched victory from harold wilson ' s labour party .  they all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001 .  "we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn ' t happen , " said john murray ,  of aldridge browhills conservatives .  "it was very disappointing .  this time it really is different .  "whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on .  blair is on the back foot . " much of the credit for the tories '  recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby ,  the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper john howard ,  of australia ' s liberal party ,  into a serial election winner .  the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10 .  even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls ,  they are still behind ,  when to have a chance of overturning labour ' s whopping majority ,  they should really be ahead .  but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper ,  the party at least has reason to hope that ,  like his australian namesake ,  mr howard really isn ' t finished yet .

" rush was appointed at the end of august following the departure of former liverpool team-mate mark wright ,  who guided chester to the conference title last season .  chester were bottom of league two when rush took over but the former liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life ,  taking the club into the third round of the fa cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for october .  chester ' s downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the league two relegation zone . 
__label__tech mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales ,  according to research from technology analysts gartner .  more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally ,  said the report ,  the highest total sold to date .  the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions ,  gartner said .  good design and the look of a mobile ,  as well as new services such as music downloads ,  could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 ,  said analysts .  although people were still looking for better replacement phones ,  there was evidence ,  according to gartner ,  that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales .  "all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe , " mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website .  "japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years '  time .  "they already have tv ,  music ,  ringtones ,  cameras ,  and all that we can think of on mobiles ,  so people have stopped buying replacement phones . " but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too ,  according to gartner ,  as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology .  this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade ,  said gartner .  third generation mobiles  ( 3g )  with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer ,  like video ,  could drive people into upgrading their phones ,  but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen .  "at the end of the day ,  people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don ' t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical . " nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own .  the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms .  more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics ,  as well as music services .  the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 ,  she added .  this was not a "women ' s thing" ,  she said ,  but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too .  it was not just about how the phone functioned ,  but about what it said about its owner .  "western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design , " said ms milanesi .  "people are after something that is nice-looking ,  and together with that ,  there is the entertainment side .  "this year music will have a part to play in this . " the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million  ( £10 . 5 million )  in 2004 ,  but is set to be worth $1 . 8 billion  ( £94 million )  by 2009 ,  according to juniper research .  sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone ,  the w800 ,  which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours '  battery life ,  and a two megapixel camera .  in july last year ,  motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones .  apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola ' s standard music application for its music phones .  but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod .  ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives .  but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity ,  which would not put too much strain on battery life .

"it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level , " said naris chaiyasoot ,  director general at the ministry ' s fiscal policy office .  in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth ,  according to a government spokesman .

"it won ' t be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp , " he said .  "in the last few years ,  we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this .  now we see this can disappear in a few days ,  a few minutes . " shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m .  between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged ,  and a similar number have suffered significant damage .  however ,  many experts ,  including the world bank ,  have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact .  in part ,  this is because of its scale ,  and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities .  "calculators will have to wait , " said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday .  "the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact . "

"no individual is ,  be it the chairman ,  the manager or a player . " souness dropped bellamy for sunday ' s game against arsenal ,  claiming the welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position .  "when i heard what the manager was saying i was in shock , " bellamy said .  "i thought  ' not only has he gone behind my back ,  he ' s lying '  , " he said in response to souness '  remarks .  and the wales international refused to apologise .  "i won ' t apologise because i have done nothing wrong , " he told the evening chronicle .  "there ' s no doubt about it ,  i am out of here . " the difficult relationship between souness and bellamy boiled over at the weekend ,  and has led to a war of words in the media .  bellamy ' s claim that souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by shepherd ,  who accused the striker of "cheating" the club .  "i wish to put the record straight regarding the bellamy situation , " said shepherd .  "craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight  ( on friday )  ,  but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury .  "when graeme discovered this he immediately ordered bellamy to attend a meeting in my office .  "at that meeting bellamy admitted to graeme and i that he had told the players that he was going to "fake" an injury in training and walk off .  "he also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour .  he didn ' t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend ,  which i fully support .  "in my book this is cheating on the club ,  the supporters ,  the manager and his own team-mates .  "he is paid extremely well and i consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional . " bellamy ' s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote .  but even before newcastle said the player would not be sold ,  bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request .  "i don ' t want the fans to think for one minute that i wouldn ' t play for this club , " he said .  "i ' d play anywhere for this club ,  even in goal .  "it ' s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but i ' d never ask to leave this club .  "this club means so much to me .  i couldn ' t do it because i know i couldn ' t come back here and play against newcastle .  it would hurt too much . "

"the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them , " jeff joseph ,  from the consumer electronics association  ( cea )  told the bbc news website .  "it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist ,  taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters . " consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004 ,  according to figures released by ces organisers ,  the cea ,  on tuesday .  the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004 .  shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004 .  that trend is predicted to continue ,  according to cea analysts ,  with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005 .  the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media ,  liquid crystal display  ( lcd )  tvs ,  digital video recorders  ( dvrs )  ,  and portable music players .  "this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room ,  you can move that content around the house .  "some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere , " said mr joseph .  he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the "democratisation" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music ,  video ,  and images .  there will also be more focus on the design of technologies ,  following the lead that apple ' s ipod made ,  with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern .  the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year .  gaming would continue to thrive ,  especially on mobile devices ,  and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women .  games consoles sales have been declining ,  but the launch of next generation consoles ,  such as microsoft ' s xbox and playstation ,  could buoy up sales .  although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox ,  some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote .  some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead .  with more than 52% of us homes expected to have home networks ,  the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images ,  video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home ,  will be more commonplace .  portable devices that combine mobile telephony ,  digital music and video players ,  will also be more popular in 2005 .  their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films ,  tv ,  and audio wherever they are .  this means more storage technologies will be in demand ,  such as external hard drives ,  and flash memory like sd cards .  ces runs officially from 6 to 9 january . 
__label__sport arsenal boss arsene wenger would consider signing adrian mutu once the striker has served his drugs ban .  mutu was sacked by chelsea on friday after testing positive for cocaine - a move wenger has backed .  but he said: "i don ' t even wonder if that could happen because i think he will be suspended for a long period .  "but once he has served his suspension ,  he has the right again to start from zero .  i would then meet the player and see what he tells me . " mutu faces a ban of between six months and two years when the football association decides on his punishment .  chelsea decided to act before his case was heard and sacked the striker on grounds of gross misconduct after it was revealed that he had failed a drug test .  but mutu has hit out at the club ' s decision ,  saying: "chelsea have destroyed me . " he told the sunday mirror: "i don ' t know what i ' m going to do .  i am shocked and surprised by their decision .  "i didn ' t expect them to pay me while i was suspended but i never thought they would sack me either .  "why didn ' t they wait to do this ?  now my career is in ruins .  "i might as well walk away from football .  what is there left for me ? " chelsea have been criticised for their stance ,  with the professional footballers '  association accusing the club of failing in their duty of care to the player .  and mutu agreed ,  adding: "it is unfair .  if they were going to sack me they should have done it afterwards .  "why did they go public ?  to make an example of me ?  it makes it very difficult for me now . "
__label__business irishmen jp mcmanus and john magnier ,  who own a 29% stake in manchester united ,  will reportedly reject any formal £800m offer for the club .  the sunday times and the sunday telegraph say they will oppose any formal £800m takeover bid from us tycoon malcom glazer .  mr glazer got permission to look at the club ' s accounts last week .  irish billionaires mr mcmanus and mr magnier are said to believe that an £800m bid undervalues club prospects .  mr magnier and mr mcmanus ,  who hold their stake through their cubic expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid .  mr glazer ' s financial backers ,  including jp morgan ,  the us investment bank have said they won ' t back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club ' s shares .  however ,  there has been much speculation that the irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough .  mr glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003 .  mr magnier and mr mcmanus issued a statement late on friday saying that they remained "long-term investors" in man utd .  the sunday telegraph says the board of manchester united also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it . 
__label__politics michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts .  should he win the next general election ,  he has earmarked £4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how .  this was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters ,  he believes ,  will warm to .  at its simplest ,  it is saying: "vote tory and you can have it both ways" .  not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services ,  including health and education ,  it would increase spending on defence ,  police and pensions .  and even after that was done ,  it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax .  all the money would come from its £35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy ,  waste and the civil service .  of that ,  £23 billion would go on spending plans ,  with £8 billion to fill the black hole left ,  they claim ,  by gordon brown ,  and the rest going in tax cuts .  neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash ,  although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely .  ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax ,  although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election .  as the tory leader declared ,  the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories .  "at this election ,  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less , " he said .  it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts .  the extension of that ,  however ,  was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters .  and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes ?  he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street .  labour ,  needless to say ,  claim his planned £35bn efficiency savings simply don ' t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy .  one of new labour ' s greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters ,  business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy .  so far that has not faced any real challenge ,  but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances .  meanwhile ,  the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day .  so ,  mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor .  and ,  while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign ,  it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor . 
__label__tech apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products .  the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple ' s asteroid product .  now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit .  a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters .  apple ' s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage ,  apple insider and think secret websites .  all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products .  apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value .  the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites .  the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved .  in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg ,  apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers '  net providers .  in making his ruling ,  judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest .  california has so-called "shield" laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest .  the judge wrote: " .  .  . it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of  ' hits '  on a website about apple have and will happen .  but an interested public is not the same as the public interest" .  judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists ,  too .  the electronic frontier foundation ,  which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider ,  said the ruling had potentially wide implications .  "anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling , " said eff lawyer kurt opsahl .  mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent . 
__label__tech the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice .  the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats ,  building on many of the original ' s elements .  for its part ,  the long-running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue ,  adapting the console game rising sun .  call of duty: finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa .  it is a traditional first-person-viewed game that lets you control just one character ,  in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you .  on a near-identical note ,  medal of honor: pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight-knit team and plum in the middle of all-out action .  its arenas are the war ' s pacific battles ,  including guadalcanal and pearl harbour .  you play one character throughout ,  a raw and rather talkative us soldier .  both games rely on a carefully stage-managed structure that keeps things ticking along .  when this works ,  it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story .  when it does not ,  it is tedious .  a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault ,  where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii .  you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes ,  then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman ,  before seizing the anti-aircraft guns .  it is one of the finest set-pieces ever seen in a video game .  this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre-determined path ,  forcibly witnessing a series of pre-set moments of action ,  is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic .  the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection .  this pair of games do not really accomplish that ,  being more concerned with imparting a full-on atmospheric experience .  call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation .  finest hour has a similar determination ,  framing everything in moody wartime music ,  archive footage and lots of reflective voice-overs .  letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour ,  even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat .  the game ' s drawback could be said to be its format; tastes differ ,  but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc .  the mouse control is a big reason why ,  along with the sharper graphics a top-end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety .  call of duty on pc was more detailed ,  plot-wise and graphically ,  and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready .  targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky ,  not helped by unconvincing collision-detection .  you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim ,  yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him .  checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot ,  which happens regularly ,  you are set harshly far back ,  and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again .  the game wants to be a challenge ,  and is ,  and many players will like it for that .  it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent ,  the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive .  both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour .  and in pacific assault in particular ,  their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless .  but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial ,  designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all .  of the two games ,  pacific assault gets more things right ,  including little points like auto-saving intelligently and having tidier presentation .  it engages you very well and also looks wonderful ,  making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry ,  although we had to ramp up the settings on a high-spec machine to get the most out of them .  finest hour is by no means bad ,  and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming .  those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented .  but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent . 
__label__sport greek athletics '  governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests .  the pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests ,  including one on the eve of last year ' s athens olympics .  they were set to learn their fate by the end of february ,  but late evidence from them has pushed the date back .  "a decision is now expected by around mid-march , " said one of their lawyers ,  michalis dimitrakopoulos .  kenteris ,  31 ,  who won the men ' s 200m title at the 2000 sydney games and thanou ,  30 ,  who won the women ' s 100m silver medal in sydney ,  face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty .  the athletes ,  who spectacularly withdrew from the athens olympics ,  have been suspended by the international association of athletics federations  ( iaaf )  for missing the three tests .  the iaaf said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in tel aviv ,  chicago and athens and ordered greek athletic ' s governing body ,  segas ,  to hold a disciplinary inquiry .  the athletes also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the athens test ,  which led to them spending four days in hospital .  following the final hearing in late january ,  the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted .  "i am confident and optimistic , " thanou had said at the time .  "we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of . " it was not clear what this new evidence was .

__label__sport hong kong is hoping to join japan as co-host of the 2011 rugby world cup .  japan has applied to host the tournament on its own ,  with the aim of taking it outside rugby ' s traditional strongholds for the first time .  but hong kong rugby football union  ( hkrfu )  chairman john molloy has called for the territory to host one of the pools and a quarter-final .  the japanese rugby football union  ( jrfu )  says it has yet to receive a formal presentation from the hkrfu .  "at this stage ,  we are only considering hosting the event by ourselves , " said jrfu secretary koji tokumasu .  "we cannot examine any proposal unless we get it in a definitive form . " japan faces stiff competition in the form of south africa and new zealand to host the event in seven years '  time .  "until now ,  the world cup has been held in countries from the six nations or tri-nations , " said tokumasu .  "we think ,  and the irb thinks ,  that it is time for rugby to go global .  "japan is ready to host the tournament and we are looking forward to welcoming the world of rugby to japan . " tokumasu added that the 2002 football world cup ,  co-hosted by japan and south korea ,  had been a huge success .  "as well as having the infrastructure in place ,  japan also has the commercial clout to host one of sport ' s top competitions , " he said .  last year ,  japan launched its first professional rugby league and it has the fourth largest number of registered players  ( 125 , 508 )  in the world after england ,  south africa and france . 
__label__business federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have "severe" consequences .  speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit ,  such as increasing taxes .  while the us economy is growing at a "reasonably good pace" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us .  pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy ,  he said .  the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires .  "i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver .  if existing promises need to be changed ,  those changes should be made sooner rather than later , " mr greenspan said .  he also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity "retirement and health programmes would need "significant" changes .  he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees ,  as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford .  meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending ,  he added .  he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red .  despite the dire warnings ,  mr greenspan did offer some good news for the short term .  as us growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit .  recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely ,  which should cut some costs .  since president george w bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year .

__label__sport ireland consigned england to their third straight six nations defeat with a stirring victory at lansdowne road .  a second-half try from captain brian o ' driscoll and 14 points from ronan o ' gara kept ireland on track for their first grand slam since 1948 .  england scored first through martin corry but had "tries" from mark cueto and josh lewsey disallowed .  andy robinson ' s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 world cup final .  the defeat also heralded england ' s worst run in the championship since 1987 .  ireland last won the title ,  then the five nations ,  in 1985 ,  but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with wales .  and eddie o ' sullivan ' s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when england were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the grand slam at lansdowne road .  in front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in dublin ,  ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when o ' gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal .  england took their time to settle but their first real venture into ireland ' s half produced a simple score for corry .  the number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the irish line ,  racing 25 yards to touch down .  england fly-half charlie hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left ,  but almost immediately o ' gara ,  winning his 50th cap ,  answered with two penalties in quick succession .  england were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes ,  and hodgson ,  the villain at twickenham ,  coolly bisected the posts .  the first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking ,  but it was ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs .  a series of probes led by the talismanic o ' driscoll ,  back from hamstring injury ,  resulted in a penalty but ireland chose to kick for touch .  from the line-out ,  the ball was recycled back to o ' gara ,  who stroked his second drop-goal ,  this time off the right upright .  as the interval approached ,  wing josh lewsey was the catalyst for england ' s most promising attack .  the wasps star raced up his touchline and hodgson ' s cross-kick put in mark cueto for an apparent score ,  but the sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker .  england began the second half well and had ireland pinned in their own half .  but another english indiscretion on a rare irish break-out awarded o ' gara a kick at goal ,  which he missed .  england ' s pressure continued ,  and a wave of attacks saw centre jamie noon dragged down yards from the line before hodgson landed a drop-goal .  the lead was shortlived ,  however .  ireland raced upfield ,  deft handling from the backs ,  including a clever dummy from geordan murphy on hodgson ,  ending with o ' driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts .  o ' gara missed a penalty which would have put ireland nine points clear ,  and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when hodgson ' s cross-kick was fumbled by lock ben kay near the line .  anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high ,  but o ' gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt .  inside the last 10 minutes ,  england poured forward ,  spurred on by scrum-half matt dawson ,  who replaced leicester ' s harry ellis .  but despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the tv replay by referee jonathan kaplan - england were unable to pull off a face-saving win .  ireland next face france at lansdowne road in two weeks '  time before the potential title decider against wales in cardiff .  england are still to meet italy at twickenham ,  in what is now a wooden spoon decider ,  and scotland .  g murphy; g dempsey ,  b o ' driscoll ,  s horgan ,  d hickie; r o ' gara ,  p stringer; r corrigan ,  s byrne ,  j hayes; m o ' kelly ,  p o ' connell; s easterby ,  j o ' connor ,  a foley .  f sheahan ,  m horan ,  d o ' callaghan ,  e miller ,  g easterby ,  d humphreys ,  k maggs .  j robinson  ( capt ) ; m cueto ,  j noon ,  o barkley ,  j lewsey; c hodgson ,  h ellis; g rowntree ,  s thompson ,  m stevens; d grewcock ,  b kay; j worsley ,  l moody ,  m corry .  a titterrell ,  d bell ,  s borthwick ,  a hazell ,  m dawson ,  a goode ,  o smith .

__label__politics with impeccable and precisely-calculated timing ,  tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard ' s latest announcement on taxation and spending .  with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election ,  mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories '  resolutely depressing poll showings .  the big idea is his £35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts .  and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one ' s breakfast with frost programme .  he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now ,  but without any concrete pledges .  but mr howard announced that ,  of the £35bn he has earmarked from savings ,  £12bn will be used to plug labour ' s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin ' s first budget .  he would not be precise ,  but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax .  but he did ,  for the first time ,  say there would be such tax cuts .  "at this election ,  people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less" .  it is the tories '  attempt to open that famed "clear blue water" between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters .  so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that ,  when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches ,  his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact .  mr howard ,  however ,  was dismissive .  "these things happen from time to time .  there are disagreements between robert jackson and me .  "the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did , " he added .  and that is certainly true .  the election will be decided on "the economy stupid" .  other issues like the iraq war and the "trust" thing will also play a major part .  but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote .  and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda .  mr howard knows that risks accusations that ,  as a result ,  he would slash public services ,  so he has attempted to shoot that fox first .  with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts ,  he has suggested that is exactly what he will do .  whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen . 
__label__entertainment a bookmaker has stopped taking bets on celebrity big brother after claiming "sensitive information" about the channel 4 show had been leaked .  william hill made the move after four people tried to place bets on friday ' s surprise double eviction .  "this is highly unlikely to have been an inspired guess , " william hill spokesman rupert adams said .  however ,  a big brother spokeswoman was "satisfied" that sensitive information about the show remained confidential .  the bookmaker said its suspicions had been aroused by betting for the last two contestant evictions ,  when people were still trying to place large sums despite odds as short as 1 / 14 .  but william hill ' s "overwhelming evidence" came on friday when four unknown callers asked to place bets on the show ' s surprise double eviction .  shortly afterwards model caprice and actor jeremy edwards left the show .  mr adams believed someone had gained access to figures which revealed how viewers were voting ,  and was using them to predict which celebrity would be evicted next .  "we think somebody somewhere has got them and has been trying very hard to take us to the cleaners , " he said .  the bets were not taken .  mr adams did not believe anyone from channel 4 or big brother producer endemol had tried to place the queried bets .  but he added: "they need to look at how many people are privy to the sensitive information . " big brother ' s spokeswoman said: "only a handful of senior production executives are privy to any sensitive information regarding eviction voting and there are strict procedures in place to keep this information strictly confidential .  "we do not feel the need to investigate this further as we are satisfied that these measures are effective . " the show ' s independent adjudicator - the electoral reform services - was also satisfied ,  she added .  the current series of celebrity big brother ends on sunday ,  with happy mondays star bez ,  actress brigitte nielsen and blazin '  squad rapper kenzie competing for a £50 , 000 charity prize .  bookmaker ladbrokes said it would continue to accept bets on the final ,  with kenzie its favourite at 2 / 9 .  "we felt no need whatsoever to close the book , " spokesman warren lush said .  "we ' ve seen absolutely no suspicious betting patterns . " mr lush added that people sometimes vote on short odds "because they think it ' s like buying money" .  "you do have to risk quite a lot of money for a very small gain but if they think there ' s no chance of an upset they will still do it , " he said . 
__label__tech soon you could go hunting via the net .  a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer ,  antelope and wild pigs .  for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare texas ranch .  the live-shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet .  john underwood ,  the man behind the live-shot website ,  said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site .  "we were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said  ' if you just had a gun for that '  .  a little light bulb went off in my head , " mr underwood told the reuters news agency .  a year ' s work and $10 , 000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and  . 22 calibre rifle .  mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals .  also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig .  each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work .  species that can be shot will include barbary ,  corsican and mouflon sheep ,  blackbuck antelope and wild pigs .  already the live-shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5 . 95 for each 20-minute shooting session .  for further fees ,  users can get the target they shot and a dvd recording of their session .  handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be .  mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas .  in a statement the rspca said it had "grave concerns" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle .  "we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a  ' clean kill '  ,  something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport , " it said .  "animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily , " said the statement .  mike berger ,  wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department ,  said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting .  he said state laws on hunting only covered "regulated animals" such as native deer and bird species .  as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt "unregulated" imported animals and wild pigs .  mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals . 
__label__business fiat will meet car giant general motors  ( gm )  on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm ' s loss-making auto group .  fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract ,  signed in 2000 ,  is no longer valid .  press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim .  both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand .  the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm ' s rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich ,  according to the reuters news agency .  mr marchionne is confident of his firm ' s legal position ,  saying in an interview with the financial times that gm ' s argument "has no legs" .  the agreement in question dates back to gm ' s decision to buy 20% of fiat ' s auto division in 2000 .  at the time ,  it gave the italian firm the right ,  via a  ' put option '  ,  to sell the remaining stake to gm .  in recent weeks ,  fiat has reiterated its claims that this  ' put '  is still valid and legally binding .  however ,  gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year ,  which cut gm ' s holding to 10% ,  together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement .  selling the fiat ' s car-making unit may not prove so simple ,  analysts say ,  especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy ' s industrial heritage .  political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise .  "we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point , " brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors ,  adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business .  "as far as we are aware ,  the agnelli family ,  which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat ,  has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business .

__label__sport a us judge has set a preliminary trial date for the balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics .  us district court judge susan ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco .  and she set a march date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard .  a firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in january .  the judge said that she may conduct hearings in january into whether federal agents illegally searched the balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company ' s founder victor conte and its vice-president james valente .  the two men - along with personal trainer greg anderson and athletics coach remy korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence .  the outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed .  conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an american tv show on friday .  "the world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs , " he said .  balco  ( the bay area laboratory cooperative )  is the company at the centre of the scandal .  the company has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency  ( usada )  of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil .  the usada claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for thg and modafinil .  former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation .  britain ' s former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003 . 
__label__politics a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet ,  the elections watchdog has said .  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit .  in a new report ,  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a £10 , 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it .  it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning .  there were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 ,  2002 and 2003 ,  with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m .  the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions .  the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work .  "while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap ,  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible , " says its report .  if there was to be a cap ,  it should be £10 , 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003 .  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200 .  it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons ,  european parliament ,  scottish parliament ,  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly .  and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning ,  seen as a way of improving voter turnout .  all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets ,  says the watchdog .  and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters .  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates ,  while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m .  the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections .  electoral commission chairman sam younger said: "there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced .  "our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible .  "the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations . " he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system . 
__label__business china ' s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005 ,  state media report .  the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices .  there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system .  growth in china remains at a breakneck 9 . 1% ,  and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year .  the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year .  rapid tooling-up of china ' s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year .  in theory ,  the government has a 7% growth target ,  but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a "hard landing" in the shape of an overbalancing economy .  a low exchange rate - china ' s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8 . 28 to the dollar ,  which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets .  china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg .  to some extent ,  the credit controls do seem to be taking effect .  industrial output grew 15 . 7% in the year to october ,  down from 23% in february ,  and inflation slowed to 4 . 3% - although retail sales are still booming .

__label__business yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia ' s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday .  the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale .  however ,  judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard .  russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos .  russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm ' s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn  ( £14bn )  back tax bill ,  which they claim is owed by yukos .  filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was "a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders ,  employees and customers , " said yukos chief executive steven theede .  the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company ' s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders '  investments .  however ,  as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets ,  lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case .  "we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday , " zack clement ,  a lawyer for yukos ,  told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston ,  texas ,  on wednesday .  as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors ,  allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government .  yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a "campaign of illegal ,  discriminatory and disproportionate" tax claims .  mr clement said that under russian law ,  the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law .  he added that the opening bid for the firm ' s yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth .  "we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom , " he said ,  referring to russia ' s natural gas giant .  yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and "will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm . " many commentators believe the russian government ' s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive ,  mikhail khodorkovsky .  mr khodorkovsky ,  who had funded liberal opposition groups ,  was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off ,  it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm ,  like gazprom ,  effectively bringing a large chunk of russia ' s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control .

" other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones ,  compared to portable players which can hold up to 40gb of music .  the mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading ,  after the success of apple ' s itunes ,  napster and other net music download services .  with phones getting smarter and more powerful ,  there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move .  in the us ,  services like tivo to go let people transfer pre-recorded tv content onto their phones .  but ,  the gartner report on mobile tv broadcasting in europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait .  currently ,  tv-like services ,  where clips are downloaded ,  are offered by several european operators ,  like italy ' s tim and 3 .  mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though ,  said the report .  various standards and ways of getting tv signals to mobiles are being worked on globally .  in europe ,  trials in berlin and helsinki are making use of terrestrial tv masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers .  a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day .  the service uses 3gp technology ,  one of the standards for mobile tv .  but at the end of 2004 ,  the european telecommunications institute  ( etsi )  formally adopted digital video broadcasting handheld  ( dvb-h )  as the mobile tv broadcasting standard for europe .  operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles ,  as well as trying to overcome several other barriers .  the cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed .  handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb-h standard .  tv services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital tv generation too ,  which expects good quality images at low prices ,  according to analysts .  people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens ,  said gartner .  digital video recorders ,  like europe ' s sky+ box ,  and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch .  as a result ,  people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control .  more powerful smartphones like the xda ii ,  nokia 6600 ,  sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200 ,  offering web access ,  text and multimedia messaging ,  e-mail ,  calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common .  a report by analysts instat / mdr has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years .  it says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009 . 
__label__politics new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs ,  bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently ,  police chiefs have told mps .  association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords .  mr fox ' s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock .  he rejected critics '  calls for the law change to be delayed .  instead ,  the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned ,  he argued .  acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee .  after the meeting ,  mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact .  "if it ' s 12 . 30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there ' s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn ' t open on sunday anyway .  "this is about getting through to the management that they can ' t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions . " under acpo ' s proposal ,  the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority .  the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods .  mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself .  "it ' s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse ,  and the strategic planning process has been less than useless , " he said .  mr fox said the new laws ,  due to start being phased in next month ,  could help if food outlets ,  public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers .  "staggering it  ( closing hours )  will be a solution if the infrastructure is there ,  if the premises are properly managed and people aren ' t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street , " he said .  "we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event .  we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this . " acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs .  home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing .  the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps ,  councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems .  culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes .  it was the status quo ,  not the new laws ,  which were causing current binge drinking problems ,  she told bbc two ' s newsnight .  leaked documents have suggested ex-home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a "leap in the dark" .  but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met .  the police ' s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time ,  she added . 
__label__politics the home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws .  house of lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week .  they said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for british suspects .  new home secretary charles clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to parliament early in the new year with proposals .  he insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords '  findings in detail .  "my duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are . " mr clarke ' s comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath .  mr heath said the judgement contained "unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal" .  he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation ' s security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made "no contingency plans for the present circumstances" .  "these detainees should be prosecuted and tried .  simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option . " shadow home secretary david davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as "competently possible" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice .  "if you do ,  we will give you every support . " the law lords '  ruling came on charles clarke ' s first day as home secretary last thursday following david blunkett ' s resignation .  in a statement on the same day ,  mr clarke said: "i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year .  "in the meantime ,  we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords . " but the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week .  lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects ,  but not britons .  lord nicholls of birkenhead ,  in his ruling ,  said: "indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law . " the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office ' s powers to hold them without limit or charge .  the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us . 
__label__sport mexican outfit red sharks veracruz hope to sign juninho if the brazilian decides to leave celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action .  their president ,  gustavo parente sanchez ,  says juninho "does not wish to remain in scottish football anymore" .  agent brian hassell insists that the 31-year-old brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place .  "but ,  if the manager is not going to pick him ,  that ' s a different ball game , " he told the sun .  "that ' s something we ' d have to look at .  juninho deserves respect .  he is not a little kid . " hassell warns that juninho could reconsider his future at celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the january transfer window .  juninho was signed from middlesbrough during the summer ,  but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old aiden mcgeady .  "he has 50 caps for brazil and he ' s the best signing celtic ever made , " insisted hassell .  "he wants to play for martin o ' neill ,  but does martin o ' neill want to play him ?  "juninho is not someone who has come through the celtic ranks .  he deserves much more respect . " sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising juninho from the scottish champions ,  although hassell believes mexico would not be his preferred destination .  "we have already spoken with juninho and he said ,  if he has no firm offer from a club in spain ,  veracruz will be his destination , " sanchez told his club ' s official website .  celtic manager o ' neill is no respecter of reputations .  "the onus is on juninho to force his way into the team , " he said .  "players get a game on merit .  that ' s the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at celtic park . "

__label__entertainment us rappers beastie boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song pass the mic .  the punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist james newton ' s choir in their track from 1992 .  although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample ,  mr newton said his copyright had been infringed .  but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition .  the beastie boys - michael diamond ,  adam horowitz ,  and adam yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music .  sampling ,  now a standard practice among musicians ,  involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song .  a three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newton ' s recording .  that finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys .  "we hold that beastie boys '  use of a brief segment of that composition ,  consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background c note ,  is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newton ' s copyright , " chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion .  mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist ,  composer ,  performer ,  and university professor .  mr newton and the beastie boys were not available for comment .

" the company is earning about $1 . 8m an hour .  despite the record annual profits figure ,  bp ' s performance was below the expectations of some city analysts .  however ,  bp ' s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p .  its profit rise for the year included profits of $3 . 65bn  ( £1 . 97bn )  for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2 . 89bn a year ago but below its third quarter .  speaking on the bbc ' s today programme on tuesday ,  lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone .

__label__politics david blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new eu immigration measures .  tory spokesman david davis told mps the uk was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to britain .  the eu has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states .  mr blunkett told mps the uk would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with .  he argued closer co-operation with europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the uk .  "if we don ' t like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the british people , " he said .  the home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his tory opposite number mr davis .  "the government is employing the politics of confusion - i think ,  deliberately , " argued mr davis .  "by confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto . " on monday tony blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of british borders .  he said an enlarged 25-member eu needs a streamlined decision making process .  mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant .  he accused the government of being "pathetic" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of "surrendering" on the issue .  and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution ,  which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over .  mr blair told his monthly news conference britain had the "best of both worlds" and would keep the veto .  "there is no question of britain giving up our veto on our border controls , " he said .  "with the treaty of amsterdam seven years ago ,  we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in europe . " mr blunkett met his eu counterparts in luxembourg on monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue .  the 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy ,  in favour of the qualified majority voting  ( qmv )  system .  under this scheme larger states such as britain are expected to have more power than the smaller eu states .  britain is expected to retain an "opt-in" right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with .  liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a european asylum solution .  "if we don ' t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours , " said mr oaten .  "the liberal democrats have long argued that britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it ' s right that we don ' t do this in isolation . "

" he added: "if you are afraid to take criticism ,  you should go and do another job . " asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to labour ,  he said: "it ' s important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute . " whether he still had something to offer ,  he said ,  was a judgement for people to make .  mr blair ' s assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the labour administration .  his comments come as the co-chairman of the conservative party ,  liam fox ,  on saturday called him "a disappointment of historic proportions" as a prime minister .  mr blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public ,  during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks .  he pledged to clamp down on britain ' s growing compensation culture ,  which has brought concerns that doctors ,  teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits .  "i was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them] , " he said .  "we have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that . " mr blair said the government was also looking at "how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others" ,  as part of a review being carried out by the lord chancellor ' s department .  and there should be "real debate" about the risk posed by public safety threats ,  he said .  "we are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds ,  sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk . " his comments come after the government announced it is to spend £200m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu ,  and the sudan 1 food scare .  meanwhile ,  commons leader peter hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen "dangerous complacency" being displayed by labour voters convinced of a general election victory .  if labour voters "stayed at home" in marginal seats they could see tory leader michael howard "coming in the back door to number 10 with the tradesman ' s key to number 10 ,  getting into power" ,  he added .

"if you have not gone against the book ,  then how can you go against the movie ? " mr kashyap ' s lawyer mihir desai said .  this is the second time that those accused in connection with the blasts have sought legal intervention regarding the film .  they previously asked that a line from the movie ' s poster ,  which claimed the film portrayed "the true story of the bombay bomb blasts" ,  be removed .  their lawyer ,  majeed memon ,  said: "we had argued that how can a film say it is telling the true story when the court itself is struggling to find the truth ?  "so we said they should remove the line from their promotional posters and they did give us an assurance that they would do so . " the mumbai bombings case is one of india ' s longest-running trials .  a special court was set up to hear the case and regular hearings have taken place there for the last nine years ,  with more than six hundred witnesses questioned .

__label__politics the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania .  the trial scheme ,  which could start in weeks ,  may be extended to apply to children from other countries .  children ' s charities have reacted with alarm ,  saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected .  but the home office says it may be in the children ' s best interests if it reunites them with their communities .  the pilot ,  included in the government ' s five-year immigration plan ,  aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims .  since 2002 ,  at least 9 , 000 under-18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members .  these children automatically become the responsibility of social services .  up to now ,  ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18 .  at least a dozen albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return ,  according to sources ,  although there is no public confirmation of numbers .  those selected could either be returned to their families ,  should they be traced ,  or placed in the care of other albanian authorities .  separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country .  under the 1989 children act ,  public bodies have a duty to act in the "best interest" of a child in their care .  laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns ,  not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania .  "if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis , " she said .  "we do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in albania] .   ' if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child ,  then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision . " in its five-year immigration plan ,  announced on tuesday ,  the government said it was addressing "the difficult issue" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children .  a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot" .  "we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused , " said the spokesman .  "we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it ' s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable .  "we do not believe that it is right ,  or in keeping with children ' s legislation ,  that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities . " the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations .  only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned ,  he said .  but andrew hogg ,  spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture ,  said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies .  "from what is so far known ,  we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account , " said mr hogg .  "in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure .  "the medical foundation has many serious concerns ,  including the assessment process for suitability for return ,  the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare ,  and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries . " a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme ,  but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries . 
__label__tech the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands .  the finished image is 2 . 5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras .  the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot .  if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution ,  the picture would be 2 . 5m high and 6m long .  the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures .  tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail .  the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 , 000 visitors every day .  the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2 . 5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge .  the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images .  the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003 .  that image portrayed bryce canyon national park ,  in utah ,  and was made up of 196 separate photographs .  the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons '  image .  "he did it all by hand ,  which was an enormous effort ,  and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques ,  it would be feasible to build a larger image , " said jurgen den hartog ,  one of the tno researchers behind the project .  "we were not competing with mr lyons ,  but it started as a lunchtime bet . " the dutch team used already available technologies ,  although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image .  "we had to rewrite almost all the tools , " me den hartog told the bbc news website .  "all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image ,  so we had to develop one ourselves . " the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens .  each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite .  the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days .  following the success of this project ,  and with promises of help from others ,  the tno team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another dutch city ,  with even higher resolution .

__label__business fidel castro ' s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba ' s ailing economy .  all conversions between the us dollar and cuba ' s "convertible" peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax .  cuban citizens ,  who receive money from overseas ,  and foreign visitors ,  who change dollars in cuba ,  will be affected .  critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards ,  reflecting the cuban president ' s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise .  in a live television broadcast announcing the measure ,  president castro ' s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states '  increasing "economic aggression" .  "the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country , " he said .  the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months .  president bush ' s government ,  which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba ,  introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may .  cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives .  a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro ' s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture .  "i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash , " says jose barrionuevo ,  head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital .  "it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue . " the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home .  this money ,  known as remittances ,  can amount to as much as $1bn a year .  those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax .  their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax ,  such as euros ,  or increase their dollar payments to compensate .  however ,  many of cuban ' s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result .  the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year ,  particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there .  cuba ' s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and ,  according to the un economic commission for latin america ,  is now worth $3bn to the country .  the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba ' s cash-strapped economy .  cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food ,  fuel and medicine .  much of cuba ' s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair .  in recent weeks ,  cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island .  cuba ' s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital ,  decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise .  however ,  a decline in foreign tourism since 2002 ,  periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy .  it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government ' s economic problems .  the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading ,  mr barrionuevo said .  "the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries ,  like venezuela ,  which have restrictions on capital , " he says .  mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity .  "it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long . "

" mido was axed by former coach marco tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up ,  claiming he had a groin injury .  but he then played in a friendly for his club as roma within 24 hours of a world cup qualifying match at home to cameroon last september .  mido added: "it ' s not my right to give orders and say when i want to play  .  .  .  at the same time i will always make sure that i put the national ' s team ' s matches as my top priority .  "i feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as i saw them play against belgium  ( egypt won 4-0 on wednesday )  and i simply want to add to their success .  "i do confess that i was rude to the egyptian press at times but now i have gained more experience and know that i will never go anywhere without the press ' s support .  "many of the international stars like david beckham and  ( zinedine )  zidane had the press opposing them .  "so i ' m now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and i don ' t have to overreact when this happens .  meanwhile ,  egypt fa spokesman methat shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on mido to apologise .  "mido ' s apology today does not negatively affect mido in anyway ,  on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players , " shalaby said .  shalaby earlier said that after an apology mido would be available for the national side if coach hassan shehata chose him .  mido joined tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the january transfer window ,  scoring twice on his debut against portsmouth .

"the public ' s appetite for salacious gossip about the private life of the beckhams might lead some into an unpleasant computer infection , " said graham cluley from anti-virus firm sophos .  simply opening the message will not infect a user ' s pc .  but anyone visiting the website it mentions who then downloads and opens the fake image file stored on that site will be infected .  the program that installs itself is called the hackarmy trojan and it tries to recruit pcs into so-called  ' bot networks that are often used to distribute spam mail messages or to launch attacks across the web .  computers running microsoft windows 95 ,  98 ,  2000 ,  nt and xp are vulnerable to this trojan .  many anti-virus programs have been able to detect this trojan since it first appeared early this year and have regularly been updated to catch new variants . 
__label__politics uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary .  it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights .  charles clarke ' s planned "control orders" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest ,  curfews or tagging .  the law society dubbed mr clarke ' s new proposals an "abuse of power" .  deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001 .  mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria ,  tunisia ,  egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death .  under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported ,  to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet .  british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects .  mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats .  human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a "further abuse of human rights in britain" .  mr clarke said prosecutions were the government ' s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in "serious" cases ,  with independent scrutiny from judges .  he told mps: "there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation . " he accepted the law lords '  ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists .  the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat ,  he told mps .  there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change .  he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources '  lives at risk .  most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison ,  in london .  conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens .  he warned: "throughout history ,  internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates .  "so unless the process is clearly just ,  the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists . " he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court .  liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence .  he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be "very high indeed" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws .  shami chakrabarti ,  from human rights group liberty ,  joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials .  she said: "adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse .  the government should not swap one human rights  ' opt out '  for another .

__label__politics tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation .  the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti-terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november .  mr blair said the bill ,  which brings in house arrest for terror suspects ,  had time limiting safeguards already .  the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed .  the lib dems also oppose the plans .  the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases .  mr blair ' s refusal to accept the tories '  sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords .  peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday .  the bill proposes "control orders" ,  which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews ,  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use .  these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial ,  which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights .  the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders ,  not just house arrest .  shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four ' s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice .  he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a "recruiting sergeant" for terrorists .  he went on to say: "if we don ' t get the amendments we regard as essential ,  including the sunset clause ,  we will vote against the bill . " in the commons ,  mr howard said it would be "far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through" .  mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable .  the second ,  less stringent ,  type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by "an eminent and independent person" .  "i believe  ( the new powers )  are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk , " said mr blair .  the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday .  lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: "there ' s a lot of talking left .  i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months . " a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a "basic principle" that people should only be punished after a fair trial .  she added: "having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either .

__label__tech viruses ,  trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change .  the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash ,  steal valuable data or take over home pcs .  viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer .  instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code .  the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs .  before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines .  but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package .  "you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to , " said pete simpson ,  head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift .  now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms ,  or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments .  "it ' s about outright criminality now , " said mr simpson ,  explaining why this change has come about .  he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order .  former virus writer marek strihavka ,  aka benny from the 29a virus writing group ,  recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers ,  phishing gangs ,  and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology .  no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors .  not least ,  said paul king ,  principal security consultant at cisco ,  because the defences against such attacks are so common .  "in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now , " he said .  few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written ,  many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data .  "if you think of criminals they do not do clever , " said mr king ,  "they just do what works . " as the tactics used by malicious programs change ,  said mr king ,  so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves .  now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network .  many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded .  as well as using different tactics ,  criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent .  "the main motivation now is money , " said gary stowell ,  spokesman for st bernard software .  mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high .  with almost any phishing or spyware attack ,  criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover .  so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends ,  to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites .  in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine .

__label__business fiat and general motors  ( gm )  have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover .  the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm ,  part of an alliance agreed in 2000 .  gm ,  whose own european operations are losing money ,  no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit .  reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1 . 2% on tuesday ,  after monday ' s 4% gain on hopes of a payoff .  the us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn  ( £1 . 06bn )  to extricate itself from the arrangement .  it has argued the deal was voided by fiat ' s decision to sell off fiat ' s finance arm and halve gm ' s stake via a capital-raising effort .  the 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat .  the german firm wanted to buy fiat outright .  but gianni agnelli ,  the godfather of the group ,  wanted to keep control ,  and preferred gm ' s offer to buy a 20% stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future ,  known as a "put option" .  since then ,  however ,  fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses ,  while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gm ' s stake in half to 10% .  for its part ,  gm ' s european units opel and saab have both had trouble ,  with opel management threatening to cut 12 , 000 jobs .  "the last thing they need is additional production capacity in europe , " said patrick juchemich ,  auto analyst at sal oppenheim bank . 
__label__sport last saturday ,  one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world .  that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham .  but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level ,  at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series .  the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion ,  with australia ' s triumph in london followed by france ' s capitulation to new zealand .  "clearly ,  there is no number one side in the world at the moment , " declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney .  "there are four ,  five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1% . " while that bodes well for rugby as a whole ,  it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade .  while the wallabies ,  all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year ,  europe ' s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray .  and for the first time in more than a decade ,  it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title .  that owes much to ireland ' s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays .   ,  who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season ,  could go one better and win their first five / six nations title since 1985 .  they start with away games against italy and scotland ,  before england and france come to lansdowne road .  their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland ' s self-belief ,  while ronan o ' gara ' s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o ' sullivan ' s side can now close out tight games .  not that england or france ,  who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them ,  will lay down quietly .  dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio ,  they still have the personnel to prosper .  the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden ,  but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson .  a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident ,  and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff ,  a fourth title in six years is within reach .  are in familiar revival territory ,  but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style .  while south africa ' s over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected ,  wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory .  if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack ,  there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february .  the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia .  a stunning defeat to argentina ,  their first loss since the world cup ,  could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency .  but the manner of new zealand ' s 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard .  fortunately for the french ,  the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris .  after two reasonable performances against australia ,  the scots '  humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent .  while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations ,  a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts .   ,  who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland ,  are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship .  as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime ,  the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february . 
__label__politics labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing "cold calls" .  the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people ' s voting intentions .  the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls .  the information commissioner ' s office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept .  telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election .  but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service  ( tps )  lists ,  which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls .  both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications .  the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies .  but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps .  a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising .  but that did not happen for "voter identification" calls .  "when we ask which party they will vote for ,  that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not , " he said .  "so it is not covered by the telephone preference service . " he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no ,  they were not rung again .  a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers .  she said: "we do apply tps but in line with the law .  we would not do things that are not allowed in the law . " assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them .  but "classic market research" ,  such as a poll of voter intentions ,  did not constitute direct marketing ,  he said .  "if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future ,  this should be clear to the voter concerned , " said mr jones .  "if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them ,  the party may well be in breach of the regulations .  "in summary ,  whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed . " mr jones said the watchdog received "very few complaints" on the issue .  earlier ,  lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying: "the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal . " he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are "significant" numbers of such calls .  "i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases , " he tells the commissioner .  mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them .

"it ' s a  ' horses for courses '  selection really , " said o ' connor .  "there ' s a lot of competition here and i can ' t just drag my heels around if i don ' t get picked .

"it ' s a good situation to be in if there are good players around you ,  pushing for a place in the side . " o ' connor ,  who celebrated his 25th birthday on wednesday ,  was touted by wasps director of rugby warren gatland as a possible 2005 lions test openside as far back as last september .  and his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of o ' sullivan ' s mind for the scottish tussle .  o ' connor added: "it will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed ,  with the new laws having come in .

__label__politics gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters ,  warning the "stakes are too high" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election .  the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a "clear and fundamental" choice between labour investment and tory cuts .  he told his party ' s spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win .  the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour .  to a packed audience at gateshead ' s sage centre ,  mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher ,  gp and nurse in the country .  laying into the conservative ' s record in government he said: "i give you this promise - with labour ,  britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation ,  15% interest rates ,  £3bn in lost reserves ,  250 , 000 repossessed ,  one million in negative equity and three million unemployed .  "never again tory boom and bust .  "this will be the central dividing line at the election ,  between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of £35bn in our services ,  and a labour government taking britain forward ,  which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals ,  schools and public services and ,  i am proud to say ,  spend by 2008 £60bn more . " turning to the economy ,  the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power .  he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty .  and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder .  "my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto , " he said .  "and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers '  initiative . " in the speech ,  which prompted a standing ovation ,  he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years .  he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world ' s poorest countries ,  a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds ,  the creation of a network of children ' s centres and flexibility in maternity leave .  responding to the speech ,  shadow chief secretary to the treasury ,  george osborne ,  said: "this was more talk from gordon brown .  "we ' ve heard it all before .  instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past .  "he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans .  "there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives ,  or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown . " liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it .  "for all his trumpeting of labour ' s management of the economy ,  gordon brown ' s record is very mixed , " he said .  "gordon brown has created a system of massive centralisation and bureaucracy ,  a system which subjects millions of people to means testing ,  and a system of taxation which is extremely complex .  "for all his positive words ,  gordon brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon ,  not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation . " also in gateshead ,  the prime minister took questions sent in by e-mail ,  text message and telephone as part of labour ' s attempt to engage the public in their campaign .  mr blair told the audience he believed the iraq war would have made britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible ,  but not before the job was done .  he also said he wanted to carry on as pm "because i still think that there are big changes our country needs" .

"you ' ve just got to confront it and say to people let ' s have a discussion on the things that worry you ,  the things that make you say  ' i can ' t trust you '  or  ' i am against you on this .  ' " the "worst thing in politics" was that the electorate only got "little snatches of policy" from things like prime minister ' s questions and the news headlines .  this was why he wanted to "get out of the 30 seconds on the news , " he added .  by talking through policies at least people understood the reason for them ,  even if they did not agree with them ,  he said .  mr blair also faced questions about british policy on iran and its alleged nuclear weapons programme .  he insisted there was no plan for an invasion of the country saying: "sometimes people say because of what has happened in iraq this is the next place .

__label__tech older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks ,  according to a two-year study .  the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus ,  spam and spyware attacks rose by 11 . 2% each year between 2002 and 2004 .  the study ,  for net security firm preventon ,  shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers .  it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired .  for the last three years ,  that has gone up by an average of 13 . 2% .  but more retired women  ( 53% )  were buying security software than retired men .  the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users ,  as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers .  the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005 .  they could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007 ,  if current rates persist ,  according to the research .  "i think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their pcs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong" ,  said one over-60 woman who took part in the research .  "you started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years , " paul goosens ,  head of preventon told the bbc news website .  "now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home . " but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online ,  particuarly if they are new to broadband ,  he said .  programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too ,  said mr goosens .  security software should be easy to use ,  with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language ,  he added .  the nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses .  high-profile complaints about rogue diallers ,  and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers ,  have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus ,  firewall and spyware-removal programs too .  without protection ,  these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally .  more than 30 , 000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses ,  a study from security from symantec showed last year .  viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer ,  according to net security experts .  programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs ,  many based in eastern europe ,  over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance .  the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because ,  said mr goosens ,  they are reported in the press much more .  "you are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat .  they are asking the right questions , " he explained .  "it is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider ,  that they are safe to connect to the net . " an unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes .  by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access .  in july last year ,  the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time ,  according to the office of national statistics . 
__label__politics former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair ' s government operates ,  accusing it of being obsessed with headlines .  he also attacked the way the iraq war was "sold" to the public ,  with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out .  tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the "most damaging testimony" he could remember .  but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style .  lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small ,  informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions .  the prime minister ' s official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues .  but he added: "you cannot ,  in a modern government ,  take every decision in cabinet .  it ' s just not possible . " lord butler said the government had too much freedom to "bring in bad bills" and "to do whatever it likes" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees .  the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine: "i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling ,  there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments . " mr howard described lord butler ' s intervention as "very important" .  "this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government .  "it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position . " lord butler ' s report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government ' s september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was "very thin" .  the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers '  case for war ,  lord butler said in his spectator interview ,  which was conducted by the magazine ' s editor ,  conservative mp boris johnson .  he said: "when civil servants give material to ministers ,  they say these are the conclusions we ' ve drawn ,  but we ' ve got to tell you the evidence we ' ve got is pretty thin .  "similarly ,  if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them . " asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said: "one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was .  the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat . " when asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole ,  he replied: "well .  i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive ,  and that is a very grave flaw .  "we should be breaking away from the party whip .  the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills ,  a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow .  "all that is part of what is bad government in this country . " lord butler ' s assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary ,  lord armstrong .  lord armstrong told bbc two ' s newsnight: "i agree  .  .  .  there doesn ' t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect . " liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler ' s comments were "well justified" and mr blair ' s style of leadership was "corrosive of the whole system of government" .  but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration ,  when he was cabinet secretary .  mr cunningham told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme: "taken together ,  robin butler ' s comments are partial ,  inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government .

series of self-contained missions within a massive 3d environment .  cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane .  all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family .  to make things worse ,  he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town ,  and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn .  the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas ,  comprising three major cities: los santos ,  which is a thinly-disguised los angeles ,  san fierro ,  aka san francisco and las venturas ,  a carbon copy of las vegas .  san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range ,  cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing .  its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold ,  assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city .  the streets ,  and vast swathes of countryside ,  are by turns gloriously menacing ,  grungy and preppy .  flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail ,  the game ' s overall look

to hang on .  cars handle more convincingly than ever ,  a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds ,  and there ' s more traffic to navigate than before .  park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway ,  and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up .  pedestrians are also out in force ,  and are a loquacious bunch .  cj can interact with them using a simple system on the

habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool .  the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym .  he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up ,  but will swell up as a result of over-eating .  and at last ,  this is a gta hero who can swim .  at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young ,  san andreas '  violence ,  or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence ,  are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade .  developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality ,  and in some respects ramp it up from past outings .  when hijacking a car ,  for example ,  cj will gratuitously shove the driver ' s head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle .  indeed ,  the tone is darker than the jokey vice city .  the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game .  this title ,  incidentally ,  is set in 1992 ,  but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists .  the wit is still present ,  just more restrained than in previous outings .  a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options ,  where gta games '  trademark humour is anchored .  the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart .  the game ' s rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed .  it is a testament to san andreas '  magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws ,  but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don ' t detract .  the on-screen map ,  for instance ,  is needlessly fiddly ,  an unwelcome change from past editions .  there is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments .  and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre ,  setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission .  but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive .  you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings .  san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004 . 
__label__entertainment the original stars of swedish pop quartet abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical mamma mia !  which is based on the band ' s songs .  it is the first time in almost 20 years that the four ,  bjorn ulvaeus ,  benny andersson ,  agnetha faltskog and anni-frid lyngstad ,  have met publicly .  faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982 .  the musical ,  which has become a global phenomenon ,  will be performed in swedish for the first time .  fans camped outside stockholm ' s cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars .  the premiere marks abba ' s first public reunion since the legendary band ' s acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s .  it was thought that faltskog would appear in london for the musical ' s fifth anniversary celebrations in april 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying .  original abba member bjorn ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band ' s mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming ,  alongside swedish artist niklas stromstedt .  almost all of abba ' s original songs ,  which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide ,  were written and recorded in english .  the musical ,  set on a small greek island ,  tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother .  the show will include such classics as super trouper ,  sos and dancing queen .  there are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide ,  including new york and london ,  with road shows in toronto ,  south korea and madrid .  more than 20 million people around the world have seen the show . 
__label__business the world ' s biggest tobacco consumer ,  china ,  has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built .  china already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity ,  according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in china daily .  the ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and british american tobacco ,  which plans to become china ' s first foreign cigarette maker .  a spokeswoman for bat declined to comment on the report .  "china won ' t allow any new tobacco factories to be built ,  including joint ventures" ,  said xing wangli ,  a spokesman for the state tobacco administration monopoly quoted in china daily .  he also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution .  china has 350 million smokers who consumer 1 . 7 trillion cigarettes a year .  smoking is fashionable in china ,  where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs ,  such as salesmen .  more young ,  urban woman are taking up smoking too .  in july 2004 ,  bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1 . 5bn  ( £800m )  joint venture factory in china which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there .  the state tobacco monopoly administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal ,  leading to an embarrassing public row .  bat told the bbc at that time that it had not negotiated with the stmc ,  and secured approval from "the highest levels of government" .  since then ,  the row has flared occasionally ,  most recently at a forum in november .  bat consistently declines to comment .  "xing ' s statement comes as especially bad news for british american tobacco" ,  the china daily newspaper said of the latest development .  the bat spokeswoman said: "there is nothing for us to add .  .  . since our announcement in july last year .  the central government of china is the authority that approved our strategic investment . " the decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005 ,  according to the french news agency afp .  the joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build .  the bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress .  however ,  if the stma continues to take a tough stance ,  expansion opportunities could be limited .  china ' s tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the west .  china daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth ,  making more than 210bn yuan  ( $25 . 4bn )  in pre-tax profits last year ,  almost double the figure in 2000 .  the paper made no mention of health concerns .  the stma is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry ,  closing some factories ,  though such moves can be unpopular with local governments . 
__label__business a close associate of former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are "false" .  platon lebedev has been on trial alongside mr khodorkovsky since june in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm .  the pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of mr khodorkovsky .  mr lebedev said there were "absurd contradictions" in the case .  opening his defence ,  he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced ,  which also include allegations of tax evasion .  "to my embarrassment ,  i could not understand the file of complaints against me , " he told a moscow court .  mr lebedev headed the menatep group ,  the parent company of yukos .  mr lebedev and mr khodorkovsky ,  who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted ,  will be questioned by a judge over the next few days .  mr khodorkovsky began his testimony last week ,  telling the court that he objected to the way that the "running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction" .  the charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country ' s super-rich business leaders ,  the so-called oligarchs .  yukos has been presented with a $27 . 5bn  ( £13bn )  tax demand by the russian authorities and its key yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill .  the company ' s effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the us - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in texas .

"the ipod mini is likely to be this year ' s tracey island , " said mr irish .  stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the ipod is at number one .  for anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market ,  stuff and what hi-fi ?  are hosting a best-of gadget show in london this weekend .  star of the show will be sony ' s qrio robot ,  an all-singing ,  all-dancing ,  football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations .  but he is not for sale and sony has no commercial plans for the robot .  "he will greet visitors and is flying in from japan .  he probably has his own airplane seat ,  that is how highly sony prize him , " said mr irish .  also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface .  the event will play host to a large collection of digital music players ,  from companies such as creative ,  sony and philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable ipod from apple .  suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless christmas are unlikely to come true as mp3 players remain the most popular stocking filler ,  said mr irish .

__label__politics the head of the "failing" child support agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation .  doug smith ' s departure was announced by work secretary alan johnson on 17 november as mps grilled him over the agency ' s poor performance .  his "resignation" was referred to by both tory and lib dem leaders during that day ' s prime ministers questions .  officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules .  mr smith ' s departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the child support agency .  in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the "failing" agency noting the chief executive "has now left" and hoping "the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation" .  on that day ' s today programme mr johnson was asked why mr smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked .  he replied: "the chief executive decided it was time to move on ,  there is a new chief executive coming in . " it now emerges that the widespread belief mr smith ,  made commander of the order of the bath in the new year honours ,  had left ,  was wrong .  a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found .  "no date was ever given for doug smith ' s departure , " she said adding that the post had been advertised .  tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced .  the csa has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents .  the work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the csa ' s performance after it became clear that ,  despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003 ,  a backlog of claims was still building up .  it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than £720m ,  while a further £947m has been designated as "unrecoverable" .  the mps found american it giant eds '  £456m system was "nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied ,  disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate" .  in november ,  when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smith ' s departure ,  mr johnson said: "i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead .  "doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post .  "so doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins . " lib dem sir archy kirkwood ,  who chairs the commons work and pensions committee ,  said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the "clear impression" the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case ,  and he may be seeking new employment opportunities .  he added his committee was "duty bound" to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the csa and it would be "premature" to say anything further on the issue at the moment .  but committee member and tory mp nigel waterson said he was "amazed" mr smith was still in his job .  "when mr smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence ,  we were led to believe he was going shortly , " he said .  "even if he was working out three months notice ,  he should have been clearing his desk by now . " asked on thursday about mr smith ' s position mr johnson told bbc radio 4 ' s world at one he thought it was a "non-story" .  he added that he had been absolutely open when he announced mr smith ' s departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a "different thing" .  "the major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we ' ve got the right people , " he added . 
__label__tech consumers want music rather than movies while on the move ,  says a report .  produced by jupiter research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of europeans want to watch video while out and about .  by contrast ,  almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an ipod .  the firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible .  the report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of europe ' s portable player market was likely to be music ,  rather than films or any combination of the two .  barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies .  only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video .  "dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in europe today despite their high prices , " said ian fogg ,  jupiter analyst .  mr fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device .  "europeans care most about music playback , " he said .  the report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players .  the research revealed that french ,  39% ,  and british ,  31% ,  consumers were most interested in music players .  mr fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback .  a separate report by jupiter forecasts that the european digital music market will grow to 836m euros  ( £581m )  by 2009 .  at the end of 2003 ,  the market was worth 10 . 6m euros  ( £7 . 36m )  .  digital music players will be behind this market growth said jupiter  .  apple ' s ipod was launched in october 2001 ,  but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the creative nomad jukebox in mid-2000 .  now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every cd that they own . 
__label__business president bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the us congress ,  seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit .  about 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2 . 5 trillion  ( £1 . 3 trillion )  package aimed at curbing the giant us budget deficit .  defence spending will rise ,  however ,  while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in iraq .  vice-president dick cheney said the budget was the "tightest" so far .  at the heart of the administration ' s fifth budget ,  presented to congress on monday ,  is an austere package of domestic measures .  these would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation .  such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of president bush ' s first term .  mr cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the bush presidency but argued it was "fair and responsible" .  "it is not something we have done with a meat axe ,  nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society , " he said .  the wars in iraq and afghanistan ,  increased expenditure on national security after 9 / 11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by president bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit .  the shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005 .  education ,  environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009 .  most controversially ,  the government is seeking to cut the medicaid budget ,  which provides health care to the nation ' s poorest ,  by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m .  spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase ,  although not by as much as originally planned .  president bush ' s proposals would see the pentagon ' s budget rise by $19bn to $419 . 3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn .  the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan ,  for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year .  also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration ' s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision .  some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4 . 5bn trillion over a twenty year period .  despite the republicans holding a majority in both houses of congress ,  the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months .  john mccain ,  a republican senator ,  said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit .  "with the deficits that we are now running ,  i am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget , " he said .  however ,  democratic senator kent conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009 .  "the cost of everything he [president bush] advocates explodes , " he said .

"in each game we ' ve missed a number of line-outs , " he added .  "it cost us the game against wales but it has improved .  "it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland .  it will be a huge battle .

"the release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case , " a motion by mr jackson ' s lawyers stated .  the estimated total costs of the trial ,  expected to last five months ,  range from $2 . 5m  ( £1 . 33m )  to $4m  ( £2 . 13m )  of local taxpayers '  money .  those estimates do not include costs to the city of santa maria ,  the superior court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case .  the cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40 , 000  ( £21 , 000 )  per day ,  said jason stilwell ,  a special projects manager at the county administrator ' s office .  mr jackson ,  46 ,  denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him .  his mother katherine jackson told us tv network fox news on sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent .

"after years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the ftse 100 ,  one of britain ' s venerable manufacturers has returned to the vaunted index , " forbes said .  mr ferguson took the helm at the company in 2003 ,  after spending most of his career at consumer goods giant unilever .  tate & lyle ,  which was an original member of the historic ft-30 index in 1935 ,  operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production facilities in 28 countries .  previous winners of the forbes award include royal bank of scotland chief executive fred goodwin and former vodafone boss chris gent . 
__label__business the uk economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0 . 4% reported ,  according to bank of england deputy governor rachel lomax .  private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates ,  ms lomax said .  other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in uk house price growth ,  she pointed out .  this means that despite a strong economic growth ,  base rates will probably stay on hold at 4 . 75% .  official data comes from the office for national statistics  ( ons )  .  though reliable ,  ons data takes longer to publish ,  so now the boe is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions .  "recent work by the bank has shown that private sector surveys add value ,  even when preliminary ons estimates are available , " ms lomax said in a speech to the north wales business club .  the ons is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on friday .  "the mpc judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate , " ms lomax said .  the bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information .  rachel lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published ,  but substantially revised upwards years later .  "the statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past , " she said .  improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the monetary policy committee  ( mpc )  makes the right decisions ,  she said .  the bank of england is working in tandem with the ons to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data .  her remarks follow criticism from the house of lords economic affairs committee ,  which said the mpc had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target .  a slowdown in the housing market and this year ' s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky ,  leading to a more uncertain outlook .  "this year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s , " ms lomax said .  "the mpc will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years . " decisions on interest rates are made after the mpc gathers together the range of indicators available every month .  the clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction ,  ms lomax intimated .  "in economic assessment ,  there is safety in numbers . "

" but she added that claims ms kelly was in charge of a £1bn university research budget were not true .  it was down to the higher education funding council and the research councils to decide on universities '  research allocations .  british law is open to the cloning of human embryos to create stem cells ,  master cells that can develop into all the body ' s tissue types .  this cloning activity is not permitted for reproductive purposes - only for research into new disease treatments .  however ,  it is controversial because it involves the destruction of embryos .  professor rothwell ,  who is also vice-president of research at manchester university ,  told the times higher education supplement it would worry her "a great deal" if ministers were anti-stem cell .  she said: "the views of ministers in the dfes do matter as they are responsible for training the next generation of scientists .  "you can ' t have a higher education policy that is at odds with the government ' s science policy . " head of developmental genetics at the national institute of medical research ,  professor robin lovell-badge ,  said he had witnessed the confused situation in the us where many religious groups opposed the practice .  he said: "if someone as senior as ruth kelly is not going to favour stem cell research we will end up with a similarly schizophrenic system in this country .  it is very worrying . " but fertility expert lord winston said he thought it was "rather good" ministers held ethical views .  concerns have also been raised by "pro-choice" organisations that ms kelly ' s views might affect sex education policy in schools .  family planning association chief executive ,  anne weyman ,  said teaching pupils about contraception and abortion were key .  "young people must be informed about all the issues within sexual health ,  which include contraception and abortion .  "i think it is very important that the government maintains its commitment to the teenage pregnancy strategy . " currently ,  individual schools devise their own sex education policies based on a framework provided by the dfes .  ms kelly has not set out her detailed views on either issue yet ,  but has said she intends to put parents first in education policy .  this would include the quality of teaching ,  classroom discipline and academic standards in schools ,  she said . 
__label__tech net users are being told to avoid a scam website that claims to collect cash on behalf of tsunami victims .  the site looks plausible because it uses an old version of the official disasters emergency committee webpage .  however ,  dec has no connection with the fake site and says it has contacted the police about it .  the site is just the latest in a long list of scams that try to cash in on the goodwill generated by the tsunami disaster .  the link to the website is contained in a spam e-mail that is currently circulating .  the message ' s subject line reads "urgent tsunami earthquake appeal" and its text bears all the poor grammar and bad spelling that characterises many other phishing attempts .  the web address of the fake site is decuk . org which could be close enough to the official www . dec . org . uk address to confuse some people keen to donate .  patricia sanders ,  spokeswoman for the disaster emergency committee said it was aware of the site and had contacted the computer crime unit at scotland yard to help get it shut down .  she said the spam e-mails directing people to the site started circulating two days ago shortly after the domain name of the site was registered .  it is thought that the fake site is being run from romania .  ms sanders said dec had contacted us net registrars who handle domain ownership and the net hosting firm that is keeping the site on the web .  dec was going to push for all cash donated via the site to be handed over to the official organisation .  bt and dec ' s hosting company were also making efforts to get the site shut down ,  she said .  ms sanders said sending out spam e-mail to solicit donations was not dec ' s style and that it would never canvass support in this way .  she said that dec hoped to get the fake site shut down as soon as possible .  all attempts by the bbc news website to contact the people behind the site have failed .  none of the e-mail addresses supplied on the site work and the real owner of the domain is obscured in publicly available net records .  this is not the first attempt to cash in on the outpouring of goodwill that has accompanied appeals for tsunami aid .  one e-mail sent out in early january came from someone who claimed that he had lost his parents in the disaster and was asking for help moving an inheritance from a bank account in the netherlands .  the con was very similar to the familiar nigerian forward fee fraud e-mails that milk money out of people by promising them a cut of a much larger cash pile .  other scam e-mails included a link to a website that supposedly let people donate money but instead loaded spyware on their computers that grabbed confidential information .  in a monthly report anti-virus firm sophos said that two e-mail messages about the tsunami made it to the top 10 hoax list during january .  another tsunami-related e-mail is also circulating that carries the zar worm which tries to spread via the familiar route of microsoft ' s outlook e-mail program .  anyone opening the attachment of the mail will have their contact list plundered by the worm keen to find new addresses to send itself to . 
__label__entertainment a low-budget horror film produced by evil dead director sam raimi has topped the north american box office .  boogeyman ,  which focuses on a man who returns to his childhood home to confront his traumatic past ,  took $19 . 5m  ( £14 . 9m )  in three days .  last week ' s chart-topper ,  the robert de niro thriller hide and seek ,  fell to number four .  other new entries included the wedding date ,  a comedy starring will and grace ' s debra messing ,  at number two .  the road-trip comedy are we there yet ?  and multiple oscar nominee million dollar baby completed the top five .  other oscar contenders ,  including the aviator and sideways ,  continued to perform strongly at the box office .  the aviator has taken $75m  ( £40m )  so far ,  while sideways has taken $46 . 8m  ( £24 . 8m )  in a more limited release .  boogeyman ,  which cost just $7m  ( £3 . 5m )  to make ,  performed well even though it was not screened to critics before release - normally a sign that a film will get bad reviews or perform poorly at the box office .  "i certainly believe it ' s a genre where people are going to be more moved by the marketing materials for the movie than by what the critics say , " said rory bruer ,  head of distribution for sony pictures ,  which released the film in the us .  overall the weekend box office was strong despite the fact that it was american football ' s super bowl weekend - a time when cinema admissions generally fall .  this year ,  the top 12 films grossed around $91m  ( £48 . 3m )  ,  compared to 2004 ' s super bowl weekend when the total box office was $73 . 4m  ( £38 . 9m )  . 
__label__tech the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents .  in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement .  mitchell kapor ,  chairman of the mozilla foundation ,  warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future .  linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft ' s windows .  it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles ,  which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees .  the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available .  other companies are expected to follow suit .  there are between 150 , 000 and 300 , 000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted .  this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office .  "some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can ' t afford to take them to court , " said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office .  some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future .  "if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software .  .  . of course they ' re going to unleash the wmds , " mr kapor is reported as saying .  microsoft did not want to comment directly ,  referring the issue instead to trade body intellect ,  of which it is a member .  "as far as intellect is concerned ,  open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems , " said spokeswoman jill sutherland .  "the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software , " "we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents ,  copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries ,  and not be forced into using one or the other , " she added . 
__label__tech technologies ,  from e-mail ,  to net chatrooms ,  instant messaging and mobiles ,  have proved to be a big pull with those looking for love .  the lure once was that you could hide behind the technology ,  but now video phones are in on the act to add vision .  hundreds have submitted a mobile video profile to win a place at the world ' s first video mobile dating event .  the top 100 meet their match on 30 november at london ' s institute of contemporary arts  ( ica )  .  the event ,  organised by the 3g network ,  3 ,  could catch on as the trend for unusual dating events ,  like speed dating ,  continues .  "it ' s the beginning of the end of the blind date as we know it , " said graeme oxby ,  3 ' s marketing director .  the response has been so promising that 3 says it is planning to launch a proper commercial dating service soon .  hundreds of hopefuls submitted their profiles ,  and special booths were set up in a major london department store for two weeks where expert tips were given on how to visually improve their chances .  the 100 most popular contestants voted by the public will gather at the ica in separate rooms and "meet" by phone .  dating services and other more adult match-making services are proving to be a strong stream of revenue worth millions for mobile companies .  whether it does actually provide an interesting match for video phone technologies remains to be seen .  flic everett ,  journalist and dating expert for company magazine and the daily express ,  thinks technology has been liberating for some nervous soul-mate seekers .  there are currently about 1 . 3 million video phones in use in the uk and three times more single people in britain than there were 30 years ago ,  with more people buying video mobiles ,  3g dating could be the basis for a successful and safe way to meet people .  "one of the problems with video phones is people don ' t really know what to video .  it is a weird technology .  we have not quite worked out what it is for .  this gives it a focus and a useful one , " she told bbc news .  "i would never have thought online dating would take off the way it did , " she said .  "lots of people find it easier to be honest writing e-mail or text than face-to-face .  lots people are quite shy and they feel vulnerable . " "when you are writing ,  it comes directly onto the page so they tend to be more honest . " but the barrier that comes with sms chat and online match-making is that the person behind the profile may not be who they really are .  scare stories have put people off as a result ,  according to ms everett .  many physical clues ,  body language ,  odd twitches ,  are obviously missing with sms and online dating services .  still images do not necessarily provide all those necessary cues .  "it could really take off because you do get the whole package .  with a static e-mail picture ,  you don ' t know who the person is behind it is . " so checking out a potential date by video phone also gives singletons a different kind of barrier ,  an extra layer of protection; a case of wlts before wltm .  "if you are trapped in real-life blind date context ,  you can ' t get away and you feel embarrassed .  "with a video meeting ,  you really have the barrier of the phone so if you don ' t like them you don ' t have to suffer the embarrassment . " there is a more serious side to this new use of technology though .  with money being made through more adult-themes content and services which let people meet and chat ,  the revenue streams for mobile carriers will grow with 3g ,  thinks paolo pescatore mobile industry specialist for analysts idc .  "wireless is a medium that is being exploited with a number of features and services .  one is chatting and the dating element is key there , " he said .  "the foundation has been set by sms and companies are using media like mms and video to grow the market further . " but carriers need to be wary and ensure that if they do launch such 3g dating services ,  they ensure mechanism are in place to monitor and be aware who is registers and accesses these services on regular basis ,  he cautioned .  in july ,  vodafone introduced a content control system to protect children from such adult content .  the move was as a result of a code of practice agreed by the uk ' s six largest mobile phone operators in january .  the system means vodafone users need to prove they are over 18 before firewalls are lifted on explicit websites or chat rooms dealing with adult themes .  the impetus was the growing number of people with handsets that could access the net ,  and the growth of 3g technologies .

"he has to strengthen it enough to cope with repetitive days of tennis , " said hopman cup doctor hamish osborne .  "it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five-setter once ,  let alone two days in a row ,  inside two weeks .  "the injury is more common in australian rules football ,  and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark ' s injury is slightly different . " the australian has suffered a host of injury problems throughout his career but is still holding out slim hope that he can make the event .  "it ' s something i ' ll have to go by feel .  i ' ll start treatment as soon as possible and try to strengthen it without tearing it any more , " he said .

__label__politics tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may .  the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and ,  despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll ,  it has not shifted .  over the weeks ,  there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term .  and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent .  the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour ' s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust .  and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster - to underline that economic message .  and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties '  tax and spend policies .  during the phoney campaign ,  labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning £35 bn cuts in public services .  the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller ,  slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour ' s plans was a cut .  and it looked like the labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks .  then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger "cuts" .  he was sacked for his gaffe ,  but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track .  a second central argument will be over taxation ,  with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again .  mr brown slaps that aside ,  claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate .  as usual ,  the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties .  but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax .  other issues are certain to play a part - immigration and asylum ,  the war on iraq ,  law and order and education ,  for example .  but ,  as ever ,  it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome .  and ,  whatever that outcome ,  2005 is set to be a far more lively ,  even bitter campaign than 2001 ' s non-event .

"jonny ' s not fit yet , " falcons chief andrew told bbc radio five live .  "he won ' t be fit for dublin ,  there ' s no doubt about that ,  but he might be fit for scotland and italy . " the 25-year-old has not played for england since the 2003 world cup final after a succession of injuries .  england ,  who have lost three six nations games in a row ,  wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to france .  goal-kickers charlie hodgson and olly barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them .  "they ' ve probably got two of the best english kickers in the premiership in hodgson and barkley , " added andrew ,  a former england fly-half and goal-kicker .  "they ' re both pretty good kickers .  charlie is a good kicker week-in ,  week-out .  "but it ' s all about pressure and unfortunately england are just not handling the pressure at the moment . " andrew also blamed england ' s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries .  "they just didn ' t have that leadership that would have seen them through .  martin johnson ,  lawrence dallaglio and jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations , " he said .  "i think it is really difficult for jason robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back . " meanwhile ,  former england full-back dusty hare put england ' s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness .  "jonny wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate , " hare told bbc radio five live .  "but natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do .  "you have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts . " hodgson ,  who has an excellent kicking record with club side sale sharks ,  has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late .  "the top golfers don ' t hit the fairway every time ,  and it is the same with goal-kicking , " hare added .  "you need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over ,  but great goal-kickers like jonny wilkinson come along very rarely . "

"i ' m really glad it was almost comical because we weren ' t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it , " kapranos said .  they signed with independent label domino ,  home of smog ,  sebadoh and four tet ,  in june 2003 . 
__label__business consumers '  confidence in the state of the us economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005 ,  an influential survey says .  the feel-good factor among us consumers rose in december for the first time since july according to new data .  the conference board survey of 5 , 000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth .  us retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 days after a slow start to the crucial festive season .  according to figures also released on tuesday ,  sales in shopping malls in the week to 25 december were 4 . 3% higher than in 2003 following a last minute rush .  wal-mart ,  the largest us retailer ,  has said its december sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-christmas sales .  it is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month .  consumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the united states .  "the continuing economic expansion ,  combined with job growth ,  has consumers ending this year on a high note , " said lynn franco ,  director of the conference board ' s consumer research centre .  "and consumers '  outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year . " the overall us economy has performed strongly in recent months ,  prompting the federal reserve to increase interest rates five times since june . 
__label__tech legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down .  one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program .  a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january .  but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are "quality copies" .  in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network .  the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised .  that file-sharing system relies on links called "trackers" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for .  shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network .  one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova . org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to .  now the man behind suprnova . org ,  who goes by the nickname sloncek ,  is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem .  in an interview with novastream web radio ,  sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems .  like bittorrent ,  exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want .  like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone .  there will be no centrally maintained list .  this ,  said sloncek ,  should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music .  the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users .  an early public version of the software should be available before february .  sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development .  there were no plans for a linux or mac version .  he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program .  despite suprnova administrator sloncek ' s involvement with exeem ,  the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis .  users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files ,  sloncek told novastream .  dr johan pouwelse ,  a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks ,  said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems .  but ,  he said ,  it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared .  "exeem cannot prevent pollution , " he said .  "the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings , " he said .  studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes .  by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality .  "the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that ' s full of crap like kazaa , " he said .  "there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity , " he said .  mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading .  when big files were being shared moderation systems were key ,  said mr pouwelse .  he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic .  "it ' s hard to compete with free , " he said .  no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development .

__label__business ukraine is to review "dozens" of state asset sales as the country ' s new administration tackles corruption .  the figure announced by president viktor yushchenko is less than the 3 , 000 cases mentioned last week ,  but will cover many of the biggest deals .  ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader leonid kuchma and has said it wants closer european union links .  in a separate statement ,  the eu said that the us should back ukraine ' s entry into the world trade organisation .  the comments came as viktor yushchenko prepared to head to brussels to meet with us president george w bush and other north atlantic treaty organisation  ( nato )  leaders .  he is the only non-nato member leader invited to attend the summit .  mr yushchenko recently defeated moscow-backed presidential candidate and prime minister viktor yanukovych at the polls ,  and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make ukraine more transparent .  earlier this month ,  new prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as 3 , 000 firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight .  her comments raised concerns among a number of investors and mr yushchenko was seen on monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves .  "we acknowledge that business in ukraine is now shaped and 98% of privatisations were carried out according to the law , " mr yushchenko said on monday .  "we have trust in this business and want to defend it by law , " he continued ,  adding that any review would focus on "dozens of companies ,  not hundreds or thousands" .  he cited last year ' s sale of ukrainian steel producer krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns .  it was sold in june 2004 to a consortium that included viktor pinchuk ,  son-in-law of former-president kuchma ,  and rinat akhmetov ,  the country ' s richest man ,  for $800m  ( £424m )  - despite other higher offers .  vice-prime minister oleg rybachuk called on the eu to recognise the steps that ukraine was taking ,  fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be a backlash against closer relations with brussels .  he said that while he understood that ukraine was not ready for eu membership ,  the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements .  "we deserve an honest response , " mr rybachuk told the associated press in an interview .  "we understand the difficulties .  we refuse to understand double standards . " ukraine may find it has a sympathetic ear in brussels "the eu has reiterated that we support  ( ukraine ' s )  fast accession to the wto and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year , " said claude veron-reville ,  a spokesman for eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .  "we have said as much to the americans .  we feel that it is important for us all to pull together for ukraine to be allowed into the wto .  mr yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on russia ,  which borders the country to the east ,  saying it was important to maintain  ' pragmatic '  ties with moscow .  "russia is ukraine ' s eternal strategic partner , " mr yushchenko said . 
__label__politics new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to "pause for thought" from charles kennedy .  the lib dem leader said david blunkett ' s resignation was a "good opportunity" to question whether the legislation was necessary .  but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now .  "id cards are a means to creating a more secure society , " he said .  mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been "significantly influenced" by the recommendations of the commons '  home affairs committee .  the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted .  earlier mr kennedy ,  whose party opposes the id cards plan as "deeply flawed" said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again .  he told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors .  "wouldn ' t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary ,  a new broom ,  to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place ? " he asked .  earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government ' s plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision .  they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror ,  crime and illegal immigration .  among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis ,  oliver letwin and tim yeo .  the chairman of the bar council ,  guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the "margins of society" would be driven into the hands of extremists .  "what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere ?  they are going to be stopped .  if they haven ' t [id cards] they are going to be detained . " the home office says people will pay £85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card .  the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill ,  mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards ,  although not to carry them .  the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents .  and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1 , 000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2 , 500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory .  the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog . 
__label__politics plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament .  tories ,  lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans .  mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats .  opponents say only judges ,  not politicians ,  should be able to order detention of uk citizens .  the government is expected to win wednesday ' s vote in the commons ,  but faces a battle in the house of lords .  the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday .  it proposes "control orders" ,  which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases ,  and curfews ,  electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects .  the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary ,  rather than a judge .  tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice ,  like the guildford four - for which tony blair recently apologised - as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects .  "those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that ' s why we have serious concerns abut that approach , " he told bbc radio 4 ' s today programme .  mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees .  he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days .  the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london ' s belmarsh prison .  they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules - and which are due to expire on 14 march .  the new powers ,  designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords '  concerns ,  would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects .  critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years .  opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days - wednesday and next monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords .  but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently .  in a rare move ,  the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill ,  saying the house arrest plans are "excessive" .  it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan "wrongly infringes the right to liberty" by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence .  mr davis told today: "it gives a minister ,  for the first time in modern history ,  the right to detain without trial ,  without showing the evidence and indeed ,  in some respects ,  almost the allegation against the individual concerned . " he questioned why there was "such a rush" to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away .  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: "we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions ,  not politicians . " mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be "rash and negligent" to ignore their advice .  nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests ,  he argued .

__label__politics lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a "fundamental lack of trust" of tony blair as prime minister .  he said backing his party was not a wasted vote ,  adding that with the lib dems "what you see is what you get" .  he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme .  questions from callers ,  a studio audience and the show ' s presenter covered lib dem tax plans ,  anti-terror laws and immigration .  mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics .  "1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair ,  michael howard and myself were all class of  ' 83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition , " he said .  "we don ' t actually hear the argument any longer:  ' lib dems ,  good people ,  reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it ' s a wasted vote '  .  "you don ' t hear that because the evidence of people ' s senses demonstrates that it isn ' t a wasted vote . " but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people .  "there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government , " he said .  "what we ' ve got to do as a party - what i ' ve got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get . " mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party ' s plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than £100 , 000 ,  saying it would apply to just 1% of the population .  he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees ,  introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax .  mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session .

__label__sport athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals .  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games .  holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope ,  paula radcliffe ,  dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 , 000m .  britain ' s men ' s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold .  holmes had started the year in disappointing style ,  falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite .  her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title .  just five days later ,  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m .  it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double .  while holmes left athens as the star of team gb ,  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games .  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears .  her decision to enter the 10 , 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining .  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november ' s new york marathon .  the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men ' s olympic squad after a poor start to the games .  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m .  but darren campell ,  jason gardener ,  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay .  the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain ' s first relay medal since 1912 in 38 . 07 seconds .  gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and ,  just like holmes ,  finally lived up to his promise in 2004 .  kelly sotherton completed team gb ' s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon .  the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003 .  but it was a different story for britain ' s defending champion denise lewis ,  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results .  lewis ,  who was troubled by injury ,  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success .  the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley ,  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin .  the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze .  and backley ' s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey ,  who came fourth in athens .  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb .  sadly ,  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse .  on the eve of the games ,  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash .  kenteris ,  the 200m champion in 2000 ,  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial .  at the games ,  adrian annus  ( hammer )  ,  robert fazelas  ( discus )  and irina korzhanenko  ( shot )  were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues .  hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol .  the fallout from the thg scandal ,  which rocked the sport in 2003 ,  continued to impact in olympic year .  britain ' s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers ,  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg .  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test .  and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence .  russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles .  her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events .  morocco ' s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 , 000m .  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon ,  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles .  rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier .  okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut . 
__label__business british airways is to halt its flights from london heathrow to jeddah and riyadh in saudi arabia from 27 march .  the airline said the decision was a commercial one due to reduced passenger demand for the services .  ba currently operates four flights per week from heathrow to jeddah ,  and three weekly journeys to riyadh .  it suspended flights to saudi arabia for three weeks in autumn 2003 after a government warning about a "threat to uk aviation interests in saudi arabia" .  ba will now suspend the saudi flights - which it says will remain "under constant review" - from 27 march .

__label__politics talks aimed at averting national strikes over pension reforms have ended without agreement after 90 minutes .  five public sector unions met deputy prime minister john prescott at the labour spring conference in gateshead .  they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65 .  up to 1 . 4 million workers could take part in strikes earmarked for 23 march .  discussions will resume next week .  a spokesman for unison ,  britain ' s biggest union ,  said after saturday ' s meeting: "at least we are still talking . " all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election ,  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape .  in four days ,  unison will start balloting 800 , 000 local government workers on strikes .  other public sector unions have pledged to follow .  the five unions which met mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations .  this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow ,  said our correspondent .  but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april .  privately ministers believe this will be the "less painful" option ,  our correspondent added .  the public and commercial services union  ( pcs )  will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions .  pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink .  "for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service ,  choice on this and choice on that - isn ' t it ironic that they ' re saying to public sector workers there is no choice , " he said .

__label__politics ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to "change the face of british politics" as he launched his new party .  mr kilroy-silk ,  who recently quit the uk independence party ,  said "our country" was being "stolen from us" by mass immigration .  he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for "truth" - would avoid the old parties '  "lies and spin" .  ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk .  mr kilroy-silk promised a "firm but fair" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election .  he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime ,  tax ,  pensions ,  health and defence over the next few weeks .  labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining "an already crowded field on the right of british politics" .  on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon ' s ashfield seat .  he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip ' s two london assembly members ,  damien hockney who is now veritas '  deputy leader .  ukip ' s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left .  mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party .  he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had "gone awol" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june ' s european elections .  "while ukip has turned its back on the british people ,  i shall not , " he said .  "i will be standing at the next general election .  i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in .  "and ,  unlike the old parties ,  we shall be honest ,  open and straight . " mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would "deliver better" as the leader of a eurosceptic party .  a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly .  the party asserts that mr hockney "has a moral obligation ,  if not a legal one" to stand down .  its leader ,  roger knapman ,  has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk .  "he has remarkable ability to influence people but ,  sadly ,  after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him ,  now  ' goodbye '  , " he said .  ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been "straightforward" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead .  veritas ?  it ' s the bnp in an expensive suit !  it ' s all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming ,  that  ' veritas '  is a party that doesn ' t believe in "lies and spin" ,  but the truth of the matter is ,  its completely useless ,  due to proportional representation ,  there is no chance that  ' veritas '  will have any chance in claiming power ,  and change the two-horse race trend .  in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television .  i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many .  it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue .  in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon !  !  good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done .  let ' s hope kilroy-silk ,  ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe .  we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu ,  we need to be at the heart of europe ,  leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go ,  not running away from it .  all mouth and trousers .  a clown .  trouble is ,  any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term .  whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do ,  none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england .  this new party might gain support from right-wing england ,  but will have little impact in wales or scotland .  hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue .  england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better ,  we can ' t rely on the usa forever !  at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election .  the electorate is disillusioned with british politics .  kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i ' ll be voting for him .  both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind .  the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people ' s bickering that who ,  in the overall scheme of things ,  really cares about their petty tiff ?  many people believe you kilroy .  you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility .  the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating .  one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls .  i ' ve always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising ,  egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion .  brilliant ,  about time this country had a plausible party !  having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people .  hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action .  fantastic news .  pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right .  the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s ,  and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local ,  european and general elections .  robert kilroy-silk ' s ego and vanity are his own  ( and his supporters '  )  worst enemy .  as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk ' s behaviour .  he took a party that was just building up a head of steam ,  and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d ' etat ,  he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two .  the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better ,  as far as i am concerned ,  but in any eventuality ,  the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other .  if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose ,  we ' d have ballot papers a mile long !  you ' ve got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief .  whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership ,  and like him i am also leaving ukip .  i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means .  the eu ' s comments last week about michael howard ' s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states .  the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party ,  rather than a  ' good old british '  name ?  is this indicative of the man - contradictory ,  vain and pompous ?  i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point .  british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians .  they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power .  as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped .  if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote .  honestly ,  who really cares ?  man with tan leaves party with no plan ,  to set up party with no idea .  as one of kilroy-silk ' s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity .  i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament .  ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk ,  but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him .  someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip ' s democratic nature .  kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician ,  in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not .  he tried to make it work ,  but they didn ' t seem to want to grow up .  he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media .  this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy .  good luck to the man ,  i say .  oh please !  this is an amusing irrelevance .  there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive  ' eurosceptic '  argument .  they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed ,  more democratic ,  more dynamic europe union .  future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness .  the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open ,  honest and straight .  what other politician can claim this .  i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like .  i shall be voting for him .  the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip .  kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip ' s party list .  he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament .  i wouldn ' t write off kilroy-silk .  while he ' s a clown and a one man band at the moment ,  he ' s a populist and that ' s always dangerous . the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters ,  that seems to be one of the factors in success .  good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle .  the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv ,  could well turn out to be my country ' s knight in shining armour .  he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them .  kilroy silk has secured my vote ,  and many more like me .  what ' s more ,  i look forward to the day when he claims victory ,  wrecks the eu ,  and rescues my great nation .  .  .  without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever !  great stuff .  the longer the uk dithers over europe ,  the richer we in ireland become ,  as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe .  oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them .  this is just what the europhiles pray for .  as the main eurosceptic party ,  ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe .  having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further .  thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election !  it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip .  robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer .  instead we have a split party and a damaged cause .  under the present electoral system ,  people must work together ,  and small parties have no hope of representation .  last summer ,  ukip achieved a major advance ,  partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk .  it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting .  ukip has a wide platform of policies ,  not just withdrawal from the eu .  this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party .  neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes .  veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk .  if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another .  so ukip was good enough for him to lead ,  not good enough for him to follow !  interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name !  every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country .  kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue .  he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience .  we wants quality schools ,  top hospitals ,  clean and efficient public transport ,  punishments that fit the crime ,  limited asylum ,  a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes .  it needs courage and honesty ,  two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians .  kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities .  recruit the right colleagues ,  robert ,  and your time may have come !  well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party .  it ' s all flash and no real policy here let ' s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity .  veritas ?  the name will doom it .  but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not ?  the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism ,  so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that ? 
__label__sport rhys williams says wales are still not thinking of winning the grand slam despite a third six nations win .  "that ' s the last thing on our minds at the moment , " said williams ,  a second- half replacement in saturday ' s 24-18 win over france in paris .  "we all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to scotland and beat them .  "we ' ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we ' ll worry about ireland hopefully after we ' ve beaten scotland . " with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb ,  williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far .  kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full-back ,  leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth .  a hamstring injury denied luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start ,  but the dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to murrayfield on 13 march .  hooker robin mcbryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in paris ,  but centre sonny parker and flanker colin charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection .  said wales assistant coach scott johnson: "they ' ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive .  "so we ' re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad . " scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over italy .  matt williams '  side has shown little in attack ,  but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down .  "italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it ' s very hard to win , " he said .  "so an ugly win can be just as effective as a 30 or 40 point victory .  "scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we ' re not taking anything for granted .  "we ' re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games .  we ' ve got to be diligent in our preparation .  "that ' s my job and we ' ve got to make sure we ' re focused . "
__label__tech car-maker honda ' s humanoid robot asimo has just got faster and smarter .  the japanese firm is a leader in developing two-legged robots and the new ,  improved asimo  ( advanced step in innovative mobility )  can now run ,  find his way around obstacles as well as interact with people .  eventually asimo could find gainful employment in homes and offices .  "the aim is to develop a robot that can help people in their daily lives , " said a honda spokesman .  to get the robot running for the first time was not an easy process as it involved asimo making an accurate leap and absorbing the impact of landing without slipping or spinning .  the "run" he is now capable of is perhaps not quite up to olympic star kelly holmes '  standard .  at 3km / h ,  it is closer to a leisurely jog .  its makers claim that it is almost four times as fast as sony ' s qrio ,  which became the first robot to run last year .  the criteria for running robots is defined by engineers as having both feet off the ground between strides .  asimo has improved in other ways too ,  increasing his walking speed ,  from 1 . 6km / h to 2 . 5km ,  growing 10cm to 130cm and putting on 2kg in weight .  while he may not quite be ready for yoga ,  he does have more freedom of movement ,  being able to twist his hips and bend his wrists ,  thumbs and neck .  asimo has already made his mark on the international robot scene and in november was inducted into the robot hall of fame .  he has wowed audiences around the world with his ability to walk upstairs ,  recognise faces and come when beckoned .  in august 2003 he even attended a state dinner in the czech republic ,  travelling with the japanese prime minister as a goodwill envoy .  he is one of a handful of robots used by tech firms to trumpet their technological advances .  technology developed for asimo could be used in the automobile industry as electronics increasingly take over from mechanics in car design .  for the moment asimo ' s biggest role is an entertainer and the audience gathered to see his first public run greeted his slightly comical gait with amusement ,  according to reports .  robots can fulfil serious functions in society and the united nations economic commission for europe predicts that the worldwide market for industrial robots will swell from 81 , 000 units in 2003 to 106 , 000 in 2007 . 
__label__tech microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features .  the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005 .  it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates ,  but their options would be "limited" .  microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs .  either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft ' s site .  those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and "add-ons" that the software giant offers .  people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number .  microsoft ' s regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms ,  viruses and other threats penetrating pcs .  some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats ,  with more pcs left unprotected .  but graham cluley ,  senior consultant at security firm sophos ,  told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision .  "it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net , " he said .  windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for english-language versions of windows .  microsoft ' s windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of .  the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time .  software piracy has cost the company billions ,  it says .  the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware ,  which 90% of pcs are infected with .  the virus-fighting program ,  updated monthly ,  is a precursor to microsoft ' s dedicated anti-virus software .  last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project ,  a uk-based pilot scheme ,  which ran from november to december .  the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free .  it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china ,  norway and the czech republic ,  where pirated software is a huge problem ,  by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows .  "china in particular is a problem ,  with piracy estimated at 92% , " said mr cluley . 
__label__tech people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends .  more than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years .  more than half  ( 54% )  of those asked in a poll for mobile firm intervoice said that they do not have another address book .  a fifth rely entirely on mobiles .  about 80% of uk adults own at least one mobile ,  according to official figures .  it is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile ,  according to intervoice ,  but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34 .  most 15 to 24-year-olds  ( 94% )  ,  and 25 to 34-year-olds  ( 92% )  ,  own at least one .  nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts '  information again if the phone was lost ,  stolen or replaced .  the survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book .  many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details ,  and with people changing their phones once a year on average ,  it becomes a problem .  they also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart ,  relying on the mobile phone book instead .  "we ' re a nation of lazy so-and-sos , " david noone from intervoice said .  "we put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can ' t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book .  "the mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart . " one in three women ,  the survey said ,  thought if they lost their phones ,  it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether .  most  ( 62% )  said they had no idea what their partner ' s number was .  mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself ,  instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves .  generally ,  information from sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards ,  or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software .  sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds .  but some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too .  orange told the bbc news website that those with orange smartphones could use the my phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online .  for non-smartphone users ,  a memory mate card could be used to back up data on the phone .  o2 also offers a free ,  web-based syncing service which works over gprs and gsm .  neither vodafone or t-mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups ,  but encourage people to use sim back-up devices .  it is thought that about 10 , 000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile .  mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year .  globally ,  more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004 ,  26% more than the previous year ,  according to analysts .  it is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005 .

"this is one of the most important infrastructure projects for regional ,  eu ,  and euro-atlantic integration for the western balkans , " said albanian prime minister fatos nano .  according to pat ferguson ,  president of ambo ,  work on the pipeline will begin in 2005 and it is expected to be ready in three or four years .  he added that the company had already raised about $900m from the overseas private investment corporation  ( opic )  - a us development agency - the eximbank and credit suisse first boston ,  among others .  the project has also the support of the european union .  analysts have said that oil companies like chevrontexaco ,  exxon mobil and british petroleum would be happy to find alternative routes to the bosphorus and dardanelles straits . 
__label__business the uk economy grew by an estimated 3 . 1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year ,  says the office for national statistics  ( ons )  .  the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts .  the ons says gross domestic product  ( gdp )  rose by a strong 0 . 7% in the three months to 31 december ,  compared with 0 . 5% in the previous quarter .  the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades .  the annual figure marked out the best year since 2000 ,  and was also well ahead of the 2 . 2% recorded in 2003 .  growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion .  "on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth , " said paul boateng ,  chief secretary to the treasury in a statement .  the ons said the services sector ,  which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy ,  grew 1 . 0% in the quarter .  the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts ,  given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period .  "the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend  ( growth )  and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown , " said ross walker ,  uk economist at rbs financial markets .  however ,  output in the production sector contracted 0 . 5% ,  the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession .  however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over .  but steve radley ,  chief economist at the manufacturers '  organisation eef ,  said: "these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground .  "whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year ,   ' recession '  is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise . " the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying ,  which was driven by oil and gas extraction ,  was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures .  simon rubinsohn ,  chief economist at gerrard ,  said: "this outturn  ( of 0 . 7% )  was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy . " and he said the gdp figures may help to "push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve" .  "the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction .  this is consistent with our own thinking , " said mr rubinsohn .  the bank of england ' s nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4 . 75% ,  minutes of the meeting showed on wednesday .

__label__politics tory leader michael howard says his party can save £35bn in government spending by tackling waste .  the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes .  the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps ,  robert jackson ,  a former minister ,  to labour .  mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election .  "let ' s be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did" ,  he told bbc 1 ' s breakfast with frost programme .  however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives '  spending plans .  fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday .  the bulk of the £35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services ,  mr howard said .  the £12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing ,  he added .  however ,  the remainder would deal with some of the "unfair taxes" .  "almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes , " mr howard insisted .  "because borrowing is going up ,  it is out of control ,  that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both .  "so part of the £12bn we are going to apply to filling the government ' s black hole ,  reducing the borrowing .  "the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today . " mr howard is expected to say that around £6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday .  the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter david james .  home office spending could be cut by £1 . 6bn ,  according to the final instalment of his year-long review .  savings of £153m at the foreign office and £336m at the department for culture media and sport ,  have also been identified .  in all ,  almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under mr james '  proposals .  mr howard said: "all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair ,  who will waste more and tax more ,  and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less . " however ,  chief treasury secretary paul boateng said: "none of the tories '  figures add up so they can ' t make these savings and can ' t pay for any tax cuts ,  which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is £35bn of cuts ,  hitting frontline public services hard . " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added: "people will not be taken in by michael howard ' s claims of £35bn worth of savings .  "this can ' t be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities .

"somewhere along the line ,  something has gone wrong and these ballot papers have not been delivered .  "the royal mail is investigating to see if they can find out what the problem is . " a spokeswoman for royal mail said: "we are investigating a problem with the delivery route in the mowden area of darlington .  "this is affecting several hundred properties ,  which have failed to receive ballot papers .  "we are working closely with the council and will do all we can to help rectify the problem .  "no-one will not receive their ballot paper as special hand deliveries will take place where necessary .  "we are unaware of any other problems of this kind to do with the regional assembly vote . " the darlington council spokesman added: "initially we had complaints from a couple of residents in mowden to say they thought they should have had their ballot papers by now .  "we then made further investigations and it became clear this was a bigger issue . " a spokeswoman for the electoral commission told bbc news online that letters were being sent out to those homes affected .  she said the commission was satisfied that measures had been put in place to ensure all voters received ballot papers in time .  so far a total of 569 , 072 ballot envelopes have been scanned by bar code at counting offices across the north east . 
__label__tech two high-speed lifts at the world ' s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet ' s fastest .  the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei ,  taiwan .  the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth .  the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers '  ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed .  in total ,  the tfc tower has 61 lifts ,  34 of them double-deckers ,  and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors .  the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december .  the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds ,  while ascending their 382m track .  the 17m / s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph  ( 61km / h )  .  curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower .  the key new technologies applied in the world ' s fastest elevators include:  - a pressure control system ,  which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers ,  preventing "ear popping"   - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations   - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft    "the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us , " said masayuki shimono ,  president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts .  the first record for the world ' s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955 .  "as such ,  it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition ,  when the record was 426m per minute ,  or 25 . 6 km / h ,  less than half the speed of the new record , " said hein le roux ,  specialist researcher at the guinness world records .  taipei ' s tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur ,  malaysia - formerly the world ' s tallest skyscraper . 
__label__tech the chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years ,  says a report .  china ' s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country ' s 1 . 3 billion people .  market analysts panlogic predicts that net users in china will exceed the 137 million us users of the net by 2008 .  the report says that the country ' s culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations .  already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations ,  said william makower ,  chief executive of panlogic .  in many western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work .  by contrast in china workplace machines are relatively rare .  this ,  combined with the relatively high cost of pcs in china and the time it takes to get phone lines installed ,  helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in china .  only 36% of chinese homes have telephones according to reports .  "net usage tends to happen in the evening , " said mr makower ,  "they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233; . " "its fundamentally different usage to what we have here , " he said .  net use in china was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country ' s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities .  the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends ,  said mr makower .  many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes .  what people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of chinese life .  for instance ,  said mr makower ,  credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt .  "the most popular way to pay is cash-on-delivery , " he said ,  "and that ' s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce . " the arrival of foreign banks in china ,  due in 2006 ,  could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare ,  said mr makower .  but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living .  "a large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar , " he said .  "generally it ' s more difficult for the government to be able to control it . " "its real value is as an open window onto what ' s happening elsewhere in the world , " he said .  government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else .  familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet .  "it ' s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it , " said mr makower . 
__label__tech nasa is doing it ,  14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it ,  couples are doing it ,  gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it .  it is podcasting - diy radio in the form of downloadable mp3 audio files .  they can done by anyone who has a microphone ,  simple software ,  the net ,  and something to say .  some liken them to talking "audioblogs" because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts .  they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net ,  on demand ,  and the "movement" is at very early stages .  "it ' s about real people saying real things and communicating , " says adam curry ,  former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting .  he was one of a community of people who created ipodder ,  a small computer program ,  known as an "aggregator" .  it collects and automatically sends mp3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play wmp formats .  those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like ,  and subscribe - for free - to that show ' s "feed" .  when a new podcast is available ,  it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer .  "it is totally going to kill the business model of radio , " thinks curry .  "i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are , " he says .  "and they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don ' t listen to radio .  "they are on msn ,  they ' ve got their ipod ,  their mp3 player ,  they ' ve got their xbox - they are not listening to radio .  "so how are they going to reach these audiences ?  "it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it . " it is a fledgling movement ,  but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it .  ian fogg ,  jupiter research analyst ,  thinks there could be potential for business ,  but it could take an interesting turn if big companies ,  like apple and microsoft ,  get involved .  "it is a nascent area but quite exciting .  it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over , " he says .  "podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid .  it is another aspect of the "time-shifting" of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want ,  when ,  and wherever you want .  audiences are in the 10s ,  100s ,  and 1 , 000s rather than millions .  more than 4 , 300 podcasts are currently listed .  curry ' s daily source code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners .  but dave winer is doubtful .  he designed the format called rss  ( really simple syndication )  ,  which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like .  podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed .  he is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net ,  scripting news .  he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential ,  not in its "over-hyped" business promise .  "we ' re the sources ,  the people doing stuff ,  and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we ' re doing .  "no matter how you look at it ,  commercialising this medium isn ' t going to make very much money , " he says .  "podcasting is going to be a medium of niches ,  with  ' audiences '  measured in the single digits ,  like e-mail or blogs .  "maybe in a few years ,  maybe six or seven digits .  but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon . " curry and associate ron bloom ' s new venture ,  called podshow ,  is to help ordinary people produce ,  post ,  distribute and market their podcasts .  because of the way podcasts work ,  based on rss ,  the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets .  "when you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience .  the audience is pre-selected .  they have decided to subscribe to your program , " explains curry .  advertising ,  in his eyes ,  can be tailored to podcasts ,  to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive .  "how i believe this will work ,  is to create a network that ,  in aggregation ,  will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters .  "i have 50 ,  60 ,  70 , 000 listeners .  i could make a couple of bucks off that ,  but not much .  if you are talking a million podcasters ,  and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves ,  then that is kind of interesting . " essentially ,  he says ,  if you are doing a bass fishing podcast ,  someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show .  he is clear the ads will not be the traditional "in-your-face" type familiar to commercial radio now .  "we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place . " it is happening already .  coffee-loving curry has sold $4 , 000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site .  others use in-show promotions ,  like the dawn and drew show .  one ,  eric rice ,  has won sponsorship from warner bros .  he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push .  some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days .  others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative .  one thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry .  the creative forces behind radio are elated ,  says curry .  for now ,  he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community .  "i should be knighted for this , " he adds ,  with a wry chuckle ,  "people are going to be so happy to sit at home ,  make their podcast ,  and make a little money . "
__label__politics a senior tory mp has criticised agriculture department defra ' s "lackadaisical" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak .  public accounts committee chairman edward leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis .  the national audit office said defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks .  but mr leigh said the department was "dragging its heels" .  that comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry .  he also said defra had been "dreadfully slow" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis .  the outbreak ,  which began in 2001 ,  led to the slaughter of 6 . 5 million animals ,  devastated many farms and rural businesses ,  and is estimated to have cost the uk up to £8bn .  "four years after the outbreak ,  defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors '  costs ,  and £40m of invoices remain unpaid , " mr leigh said .  mr leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an it system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed .  in november it emerged european commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the uk government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis .  ministers had hoped to get £900m from the european union vet fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m .  that was because the uk had valued the culled animals at between "two and three times" the commission ' s assessment of their likely market value .  national audit office chief sir john bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at .  on the issue of the unpaid invoices ,  sir john said defra had paid 97% of the £1 . 3bn submitted by contractors since 2001 ,  "but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations" .  mr leigh said being "better prepared" would also help avoid the need for "mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak" .  a defra spokesman said: "we welcome the report .  it acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak .  "however ,  the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable . "
__label__tech ask jeeves has bought the bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs .  the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read ,  search and share all the blogs they are interested in .  ask jeeves said it was not planning to change bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web .  how much ask jeeves paid for bloglines was not revealed .  bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually .  to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication  ( rss )  that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals .  the acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites .  google acquired pyra labs ,  makers of the blogger software ,  in 2003 .  in 2004 msn introduced its own blog system and yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries .  jim lanzone ,  vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us ,  said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world .  he said ask jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it .  "the universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers , " he said .  mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask ' s my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links .  "search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites , " he said .  it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates .  there would be no instant sweeping changes to bloglines ,  said mr lanzone .  "our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away , " he said .  though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology .  "being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right , " said mr lanzone .  rumours about the acquisition were broken by the napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from ask jeeves insiders .

"the main point i have made is i want to be in a liverpool side which challenges for the champions league and the title all the time , " he said afterwards .  "i want to be winning things with liverpool ,  not somewhere else .  "i am a fan as well and i think what i have said the supporters will agree with .

"steven can win all he wants with us and we need him .  he has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future , " said benitez .  "but if we want to win more games ,  important games ,  we need steven in the team .  "we need his strength ,  the strong mentality he has and his quality .  i think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team . "
__label__business lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness .  cynthia cooper ,  worldcom ' s ex-head of internal accounting ,  alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002 .  her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn  ( £5 . 7bn )  accounting fraud .  mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy .  prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom ,  ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates .  but ms cooper ,  who now runs her own consulting business ,  told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom ' s accounting in early 2001 and 2002 .  she said andersen had given a "green light" to the procedures and practices used by worldcom .  mr ebber ' s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud ,  arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems .  ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company ' s finance chief ,  giving only "brief" answers himself .  the prosecution ' s star witness ,  former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan ,  has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm ,  telling him to "hit our books" .  however ,  ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned "anything uncomfortable" about worldcom ' s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting .  mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing .  worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004 ,  and is now known as mci .  last week ,  mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6 . 75bn .

" the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti-doping agency  ( wada )  ,  the international tennis federation  ( itf )  or the women ' s tennis accosiation  ( wta )  .  the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested .  speaking at the australian open on monday ,  before eerdekens identified her ,  kuznetsova said: "i ' m not worried .  i ' m not using anything to push myself .  "i have not been notified of any positive test ,  and i think it is unfair that it ' s come out the way it did . " eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player ' s address in spain ,  as well as to the belgian prosecutors '  office and the belgian and russian tennis federations .  he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance .  "we have simply stated a fact , " he said .  "it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence .  "either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection . " however ,  kuznetsova ' s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev .  "first of all ,  this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing ,  without any basic evidence , " tarpishchev said .  "we all know the basic principle in doping cases .  if there is a positive sample ,  then they should notify the international tennis federation  ( itf )  as well as the national federation within three days , " he said .  "this is not the case here .  as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials ,  nor did the itf .  "today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it .  "if wada  ( the world anti-doping agency )  was behind the testing ,  then we would also have known something by now .

__label__tech the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm ' s prototype blue gene / l machine .  it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory ,  a us department of energy  ( doe )  lab .  doe test results show that blue gene / l has managed speeds of 70 . 72 teraflops .  the current top machine ,  japan ' s nec earth simulator ,  clocks up 35 . 86 .  due next week ,  the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world .  it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second .  the speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet ,  yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles .  the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed ,  according to the linpack benchmark .  until the official list is published ,  however ,  blue gene / l ' s position will not be confirmed ,  and there are expected to be some other new entries .  but the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement .  surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second  ( teraflop )  mark has been considered a landmark for some time .  the ibm blue gene / l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version ,  due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005 .  its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops ,  and will fit into 64 full racks .  it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power ,  a big problem for supercomputers .  the final machine will help scientists work out the safety ,  security and reliability requirements for the us ' s nuclear weapons stockpile ,  without the need for underground nuclear testing .  the earth simulator has held on to the top spot since june 2002 .  it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity .  but in september ,  ibm said that another blue gene / l machine clocked up 36 . 01 teraflops ,  marginally surpassing the earth simulator ' s performance .  this was achieved during internal testing at ibm ' s production facility in rochester ,  minnesota ,  though ,  so was not an official record .  another giant to enter the fray is silicon graphics '  columbia supercomputer based at nasa ' s ames research center in california .  it would be used to model flight missions ,  climate research ,  and aerospace engineering .  the linux-based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42 . 7 teraflops in october .  supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society .  their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts ,  help design better cars ,  and improve disease diagnosis .  ibm ' s senior vice president of technology and manufacturing ,  nick donofrio ,  believes that by 2006 ,  blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing .  this means it would be capable of doing 1 , 000 trillion operations a second .  "when you get a computer as large as a petaflop ,  you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world , " mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website .  "you can start to be more proactive ,  more interactive and more innovative . " one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing - and blue gene machines in particular - as crucial is health .  he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century: protein folding .  "health is one of the most important problems ,  not just mapping the human genome ,  but also protein structures .  "we are a great believer in simulation .  it gives you another tool , " he said .  once the structures of proteins are understood fully ,  then drugs can be tailor-made to fight diseases more effectively .  compared with the current fastest supercomputers ,  blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact .  since the first supercomputer ,  the cray-1 ,  was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 ,  computational speed has leaped 500 , 000 times .  the cray-1 was capable of 80 megaflops  ( 80 million operations a second )  .  the blue gene / l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster .  started in 1993 ,  the top 500 list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world .  it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh . 
__label__politics military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of scotland ' s army regiments .  a committee of the army board ,  which is made up of the most senior defence figures ,  will discuss plans for restructuring regiments on monday .  the proposals include cutting scotland ' s six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment .  the plans have faced stiff opposition from campaigners and politicians alike .  the committee ' s decision must be ratified by defence secretary geoff hoon and prime minister tony blair .  it is expected that it will be made public next week .  when ministers announced a reorganisation of the army it drew a question mark over the futures of the black watch ,  the kings own scottish borderers ,  the royal scots ,  the royal highland fusiliers and the argyll and sutherland highlanders .  in october ,  the council of scottish colonels proposed the merger of the royal scots and the king ' s own scottish borderers into a single battalion .  under their vision ,  it would be one of five in the new super regiment .  the proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry ,  with labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan .  they felt the timing was insensitive because the black watch was in the frontline in iraq ,  suffering casualties .  the save the scottish regiments campaigners were so angered they threatened to stand against labour at the next general election .  speaking ahead of the expected army board meeting ,  a spokesman said: "the government and the army board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the scottish regiments are for the good of the army and for that of the serving soldier .  "they are very much not for the good and will destroy scotland ' s regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems ,  a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to scotland of an important part of her heritage and ,  most importantly ,  her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world . " an alternative blueprint had been put forward by labour mp eric joyce ,  who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments .  for a brief time ,  there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan ,  but that now seems unlikely .  speaking in scotland last week ,  mr blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely .  he said: "they don ' t want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it ,  all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly . " the prime minister said he hoped campaigners '  concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount .

__label__politics the government must act quickly on the law lords '  ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful ,  mary robinson has said .  the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4 ' s today the government ' s response would be scrutinised internationally .  "it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it , " she said .  home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present .  speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett ' s resignation ,  mr clarke said: "i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year .  "in the meantime ,  we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords . " mrs robinson said the law lords '  ruling was "in line with international legal opinion" and praised their "very decisive" eight to one majority .  "what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government ,  but say that there had been a disproportionate use ,  that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn ' t apply to british citizens , " she said .  mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg .  "if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress ,  including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords . " she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications .  "i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at ,  both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles ,  but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there . " the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office ' s powers to hold them without limit or charge .  the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us .  any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported .  the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions "in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status" .  the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case .
